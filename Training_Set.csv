2000,1,217,109,1,1,0,2,PLEASE LOOK INTO THE FUEL SYSTEMS OF THE 2000 FORD FOCUS. MY SON AND HIS FRIEND WERE KILLED IN AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT ON 12/8 IN DETROIT MI. EARLY THAT MORNING THEY STRUCK A FIRE HYDRANT AND THE CAR EXPLODED (BACK OF THE ENGINE FIRE).  EARLIER IN THE SUMMER OF 2004 I HAD DRIVEN THE CAR HOME TURNED OFF THE ENGINE AND GONE IN THE HOUSE. ABOUT 5 MINUTES LATER. I CAME OUT TO GO TO DINNER WITH MY WIFE...THE CAR WOULDN'T TURN OVER. WHEN I GOT OUT I FOUND GAS SPEWED ALL OVER THE STREET. I HOSED DOWN THE AREA AND HAD THE CAR TOWED TO BILL BROWN FORD-LIVONIA MI. THE CAR WAS REPAIRED AND I WAS ASSURED THAT ALL WAS WELL. NOW 5-6 MONTHS LATER THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED.  I AM NOT SUGGESTING THAT THE ACCIDENT (HITTING THE HYDRANT) WASN'T MY SON'S DOING. HOWEVER THE SPEED AT WHICH THE ACCIDENT OCCURRED (EST. AT 35 MPH) SHOULDN'T HAVE RESULTED IN A FUEL LINE BREAK AND FIRE. PLEASE CHECK INTO THE INCIDENT. THE INCIDENT REPORT NUMBER (DETROIT POLICE DEPARTMENT) IS [XXX]. THE VIN NUMBER OF THE CAR IS [XXX]. THE SERVICE RECORD AT BILL BROWN FORD WILL NOTE A LONG HISTORY OF FUEL SYSTEM PROBLEMS INCLUDING THE ISSUE NOTED ABOVE (GAS ON THE STREET). MORE THAN ANYTHING I WANT TO PREVENT ANOTHER TRAGEDY.

2001,7,265,106,0,0,0,0,SUBFRAME RUST CAUSED BY MISPOSITIONED A/C DRAIN PIPE    DROPPED MY CAR OFF FOR HER 200K TUNE IN NH. THE MECHANIC SAID THE SUBFRAME UNDERNEATH THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WAS SHOT. I DEBATED WHETHER TO SPEND $1100 FOR A USED SUBFRAME AND LABOR. DECIDED IT WAS A GAMBLE BUT PROBABLY WORTH IT. DROPPED IT OFF TWO DAYS LATER AND HE SHOWED ME WHERE. I GRABBED THE FRAME AND IT JUST CRUMBLED. WITH THE NEW SUBFRAME AND TUNE SHE RUNS LIKE NEW EVEN AT 200K.    LATER I DID MORE RESEARCH LATER AND FOUND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. I GOT THE CAR UP ON A FRIEND'S LIFT AND FOUND THE A/C DRAIN HOSE. IT WAS HIGH UP IN THE CAR AND REALLY SHORT! IT POINTED DIRECTLY AT THE SUBFRAME. I SIMPLY REPLACED THE HOSE CLAMPED IT ON THEN TIED THE END TO A THINGY FURTHER DOWN SO THAT THE OPENING POINTED AT THE GROUND. LIKE $2 IN PARTS AND 20 MINUTES AND I'M AN AMATEUR. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT HONDA NEVER OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS DESIGN DEFECT. I GET THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR SUBFRAME REPLACEMENTS - THEY'RE A BUSINESS YADDA YADDA. BUT IT'S SUCH A BASIC OVERSIGHT WITH AN EASY SOLUTION. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DILIGENCE ON THEIR PART WOULD HAVE SAVED ME OVER A THOUSAND BUCKS. SUBFRAME RUST IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. THEY DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED FOR SUCH LAZINESS AND NEGLIGENCE.    TO NIP THIS IN THE BUD: YES I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND. THERE'S A LOT OF SALT ON THE ROADS BUT I WASH THE UNDERCARRIAGE REGULARLY. AND IF IT WERE GENERAL WEAR-N-TEAR THE ENTIRE SUBFRAME WOULD HAVE HAD SIMILAR LEVELS OF DAMAGE. HOWEVER THE ROT WAS LOCALIZED DIRECTLY UNDER THE A/C DRAIN HOSE.    ALSO THE DEALERSHIP SAID NOTHING ABOUT SUBFRAME RUST WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR THE AIRBAG RECALL. SOME 100 POINT INSPECTION HUH?,N

I AM VERY CAREFUL WHEN I AM AT AN INTERSECTION OR TRYING TO MERGE INTO TRAFFIC ON A HIGHWAY FROM AN ENTRY RAMP.    I FOUND THAT THIS IS BECAUSE OF A MALFUCTION IN THE TRANSMISSION AND THE BUSHES TO THE MANUAL TRANSMISSION CABLE. HONDA HAS ISSUED A SERVICE BULLETIN ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. BUT I THINK THIS IS A SERIOUS HAZARD BECAUSE THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN YOU ARE AT LOW SPEEDS IN SECOND GEAR AND TRYING TO ACCELERATE.  CAUSES PROBLEMS AT INTERSECTIONS YIELD SIGNS AND EXIT RAMPS.

I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED THAT THE INTENTION OF THE DEALERSHIP IS TO STALL TILL THE WARRANTY RUNS OUT (I'M GETTING CLOSE) THEN TELL ME IT'S MY PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH.    I BELIEVE THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE NOT BEING ABLE TO SHIFT INTO FIRST GEAR HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE A CHAIN REACTION PILE-UP AS THERE ARE STOPLIGHTS HIGHWAYS ON HILLS NEAR WHERE I LIVE.

2003,7,265,103,0,0,0,0,I HAVE A 2003 HONDA ACCORD EX-V6:  Y HUSBAND HAS EXPERIENCED THE FOLLOWING SAFETY PROBLEM ON THREE OCCASIONS.  HE DRIVES THE VEHICLE MORE THAN I DO.  SEVERAL MORNINGS WHILE BACKING OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY THE CAR'S BRAKE PRESSURE DID NOT EMPLOY THE BRAKES IN THE NORMAL SAFE FASHION.  WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE DRIVEWAY HE APPLIED THE BRAKES THE PEDAL WAS HARD AND NONCOMPLIANT (THE CAR DID NOT STOP OR SLOW DOWN) UNTIL HE APPLIED THE BRAKE PEDAL VERY HARD.  WHILE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DRIVEWAY RIGHT BEFORE EXITING ONTO THE SIDEWALK THE BRAKES BEGAN WORKING AS NORMAL.  THIS SITUATION HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS WARMED UP FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES HE TAPPED THE BRAKES UPON ROLLING BACKWARD A COUPLE OF FEET OR SO TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE WORKING PROPERLY.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.  THIS SAFETY PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT.   I LEFT MY CAR OVERNIGHT WITH A LOCAL DEALER TO HAVE A MECHANIC GO THROUGH THE BRAKE SYSTEM BASED UPON THIS SAFETY ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC AND THE SERVICE CONSULTANT MY BRAKES ARE FINE NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS DETECTED MY CAR IS PERFECT.  BASED UPON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE AND THE LACK OF RESOLVE FROM THE DEALERSHIP I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT.     I HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH MY CAR WHICH I HAVE REPORTED TO THE DEALER AND RECEIVED SERVICE FOR ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS.  THIS PROBLEM IS NOT SAFETY RELATED BUT MAY HAVE SOME CONNECTION TO THE BRAKES NOT ENGAGING ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS.  WHEN TAKING OFF FROM A COLD START AND TRAVELING BETWEEN 7-10 MPH THE CAR MAKES A THUMP NOISE WHICH ORIGINATES FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  NOT ONLY CAN YOU HEAR THE NOISE BUT YOU CAN FEEL IT THROUGH THE ACCELERATION PEDAL.  I WAS TOLD BY ONE DEALERSHIP THE PROBLEM IS BRAKE RELATED AND THERE IS NO FIX.  THE OTHER DEALERSHIP SAID THE PROBLEM WAS RELATED TO A PIECE OF SCRAP METAL LODGED IN THE SUBFRAME.  THEY REMOVED THE PIECE OF METAL AND ASSURED ME THE NOISE WOULD GO AWAY.

2005,7,265,102,1,0,0,2,I PREVIOUSLY DROVE MY AUNT'S 2005 HONDA ACCORD HYBRID ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS.  ALMOST AS SOON AS THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION THE BRAKES FAILED AND CAUSED ACCIDENTS.  THE ACCELERATOR WOULD ALSO ACCELERATE ON ITS OWN.  THE CAR WOULD SIMPLY SPEED UP ON ITS OWN.  THE CAR WOULD ALSO AT TIMES STOP OR TURN OFF ON ITS OWN.  I ASSUMED BECAUSE THE CAR WAS A HYBRID OR DIFFERENT THAT IT WAS NORMAL.  AT TIMES WHEN ACCIDENTS WOULD OCCUR I COULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT HAD HAPPENED.  THE CAR LITERALLY DROVE AWAY.  A FEW TIMES OTHERS DROVE THE CAR AND MENTIONED THE SAME.  MY AUNT PREVIOUSLY TRIED TRADING IN THE  VEHICLE BUT IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE TO TRADE IN.  ON JANUARY 112011.  A FATAL ACCIDENT OCCURRED WHILE DRIVING THIS VEHICLE.  MY MOTHER WHOM IS A PRECAUTIOUS DRIVER WAS DRIVING MY COUSIN TO SCHOOL AND WERE INVOLVED IN A FATAL CAR ACCIDENT.  THE HONDA STRUCK A SCHOOL BUS RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE.  I BELIEVE THE CAR LIKE ON MANY OTHER OCCASIONS ACCELERATED ON ITS OWN OR THE BRAKES FAILED.

2006,9,275,114,0,0,0,0,MY 2006 HYUNDAI SONATA HAS A DESIGN PROBLEM. THE CUP HOLDER IS LEVEL AND NEXT-TO THE GEAR SHIFTER. WHEN I BRAKE OCCASIONALLY FLUID FROM A BEVERAGE MAY FALL ONTO AND INTO THE GEAR SHIFTER. THE SHIFTER ENCLOSURE ALLOWS FLUID TO FLOW INTO IT AND COLLECT AROUND A CONNECTOR PROVIDING ELECTRICAL SIGNALS THAT END-UP COMMUNICATING TO THE CAR?S COMPUTER?AND THEN ONTO THE TRANSMISSION THAT I DOWNSHIFTED WHEN I DID NOT DOWN SHIFT. THE RESULT IS I HAVE TO FLIP OVER TO ?SHIFTRIONIC? MODE BECAUSE THE CAR IS PERFORMING LIKE I PUT IT IN THAT MODE WHEN I DID NOT. I TRY TO UPSHIFT BUT IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY?I END UP BEING DISTRACTED TRYING TO PUT THE CAR IN THE RIGHT GEAR AND THE CAR ENDS UP GOING FASTER THAN I INTENDED.  I GENERALLY DON?T NOTICE THE DOWNSHIFT UNTIL THE ENGINE STARTS ROARING?.DROPPING INTO SECOND GEAR ESPECIALLY ON THE HIGHWAY IS VERY UNSETTLING. AGAIN I TRY TO MAINTAIN MY SPEED BY PRESSING ON THE ACCELERATOR AND ATTEMPTING TO UPSHIFT AND IT?S VERY DISTRACTING.   I HAVE HAD A ?PLUS 5? DRIVER RATING FOR OVER 2 DECADES AND I OWN TWO OTHER CARS AND I NEVER BEEN TICKETED WITH EITHER CAR. BUT I RECENTLY HAVE BEEN TICKETED TWICE WITH THE SONATA AND IN BOTH CASES THE CAR DOWN-SHIFTED WITHOUT MY KNOWLEDGE. THE PROBLEM STARTED SPORADICALLY ABOUT 2 YEARS AGO AND INITIALLY I DID NOT KNOW THE CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM. IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE FOR THE BEVERAGE SPILL TO CREATE A SHIFTER MALFUNCTION SO IT?S NOT OBVIOUS WHAT IS HAPPENING FOR A WHILE.  THE PROBLEM IS SO COMMON THAT THERE ARE VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE ISSUE. IT IS A SIMPLE BUT POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS DESIGN FLAW.   ,N

2006,7,977,121,0,0,0,99,ON AUGUST 15 I PURCHASED A HONDA RIDGELINE 2006 FROM MY LOCAL DEALER. ALTHOUGH THE VEHICLE PERFORMS WELL THE HONDA MUSIC LINK IPOD ADAPTER WAS A WASTE OF $475.00. THE HONDA MUSIC LINK IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO USE AND IS ACTUALLY A HAZARD TO SAFE DRIVING. THE SOFTWARE REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT USER INTERVENTION AND DISTRACTS THE DRIVER'S ATTENTION FROM SAFELY OPERATING THE VEHICLE.  THESE SENTIMENTS ARE WELL DOCUMENTED AT:  HTTP://WWW.NUXX.NET/HONDAMUSICLINK.HTML  HTTP://DIGG.COM/APPLE/HONDA_MUSIC_LINK_IPOD_ADAPTER_REVIEW  I AM NEITHER AN AUTHOR OF THESE REVIEWS NOR A PAID CONSULTANT. I AM SIMPLY A USER WHO IS CONCERNED  THAT A DISTRACTIVE TEENAGER OR YOUNG ADULT WHO HAS THIS SYSTEM INSTALLED MAY BE INJURED IN A MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT.  WHEREAS AUTOMOBILE RADIOS HAVE TYPICALLY USED A SIMPLE INTERFACE (BUTTONS AND A DIAL) CONSUMER ELECTRONICS HAVE BECOME PROGRESSIVELY MORE COMPLEX. ALTHOUGH A COMMUTER RIDING A BUS OR A TRAIN MAY BE ABLE TO SPEND THE HOURS FIDDLING WITH THE DEVICE INTERFACE THE OPERATOR OF A VEHICLE DOES NOT.   I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTS AS TO HOW TO REMEDY THIS SITUATION BEFORE ANY INNOCENT LIVES ARE LOST BECAUSE THE DRIVER WAS BUSY 'PLAYING WITH THE IPOD'. THOSE OF US WHO HAVE CHILDREN SHOULD WANT TO LEAVE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE FOR THEM. THOSE OF US WHO DO NOT HAVE CHILDREN HAVE THE LUXURY OF THINKING ONLY OF OURSELVES BUT IN THINKING OF OTHERS SET AN EXAMPLE FOR ALL TO FOLLOW.  *JB  ,N

I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO MY MECHANIC AND HE ADVISED US THAT THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID HAD CONTAMINATED THE ANTI-FREEZE AND VICE VERSA AND THAT I'D NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR INSTALLED FOR $5500.00. HE ALSO ADDED THAT NISSAN HAD JUST LOST A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO REPAIR THE VEHICLES AFFECTED BUT THE CATCH IS THAT YOUR VEHICLE CAN NOT HAVE OVER 100000 MILES ON IT. FROM MY RESEARCH IN THE FORUMS THE ISSUE DOES NOT ARISE UNTIL THE VEHICLE MILEAGE EXCEEDS 100000 SO WE'RE BASICALLY SCREWED FOR REPAIRS ON OUR NISSANS WITH 100001 MILES OR MORE. I'M DOUBLE SCREWED AS I HAVE 2 2006 NISSAN'S.  MY OTHER VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY INOPERABLE DUE TO ATF CONTAMINATION.,N

TOOK THE VEHICLE TO FORD DEALERSHIP WHO ELIMINATED COIL PACK AND TORQUE CONVERTER AS THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM. I HAD TAKEN ANOTHER VEHICLE I OWN TO A REPAIR SHOP I HAVE USED FOE SEVERAL YEARS FOR AN OIL CHANGE AND WHEN I PICKED UP MY VEHICLE I MENTIONED THE PROBLEM I WAS HAVING WITH MY 2007 FORD F150 AND THEY ADVISED THAT MY PROBLEM WAS PROBABLY MISFIRE ON ONE OR MORE PLUGS. THEY ADVISED ME THAT THEY HAD DEALT WITH THIS SAME PROBLEM OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. THEY PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM WITH REPLACING THE PLUGS-THEY COULD BREAK WHEN REMOVING. IF THAT HAPPENS AND IT DID (4 PLUGS BROKE) THEN ADDITIONAL LABOR COSTS WOULD BE ADDED TO MY BILL. END RESULT A BILL FOR $600.00 TO REPLACE 8 SPARK PLUGS. ABSOLUTELY ABSURD. AS A PART OF THIS EXPERIENCE I HAVE LEARNED THAT FORD MFG THIS ENGINE FROM 2005-2007 AND WHEN THIS ISSUE BEGAN TO SURFACE THAT THEY CHANGED THE ENGINE DESIGN TO ELIMINATE THIS PROBLEM. FORD WAS OBVIOUSLY AWARE THAT A FUTURE PROBLEM WAS GOING TO BE FACED BY THE CONSUMER. WHY SHOULD WE THE CONSUMER HAVE TO BEAR THE FULL EXPENSE TO PAY FOR THEIR FLAWED DESIGN IN THIS ENGINE. THEY SHOULD BE WILLING TO ADMIT THEIR MISTAKE BUT APPARENTLY IT IS GOING TO TAKE SOME LEGAL PRESSURE TO GET THIS DONE. IF THEY DO NOT STEP UP I WILL NEVER BY ANOTHER FORD.  ,N

I HAD A 2015 PRIUS V FOR THE LAST WEEK AND IT HAS THE SAME PROBLEM WITH THE PASSENGER AIRBAG NOT TURNING ON WHEN MY WIFE IS PRESENT.  THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE IF SOMETHING WAS TO HAPPEN THEN THE PASSENGER WILL BE DEAD BECAUSE THE AIRBAG DID NOT WORK.  WHEN I WENT TO PICK UP THE CAR ONE OF THE MANAGER TOLD ME THE AIRBAG WILL NOT BE ACTIVE UNTIL THE PASSENGER IS 150 POUNDS OR MORE.  TWO PEOPLE IN THE SAME DEALERSHIP GAVE ME DIFFERENT NUMBER FOR WHEN THE AIRBAG WILL ACTUALLY WORK AND SAVE THE PASSENGERS LIFE.

THE VEHICLE WAS A LATE MODEL LINCOLN TOWN CAR. ONE PERSON WAS PRONOUNCED DEAD AT THE HOSPITAL AND THE DRIVER DIED A FEW DAYS LATER.     THE FOLLOWING IS A QUOTE FROM THE NEXT DAY BREVARD COUNTY FLORIDA LOCAL NEWSPAPER (FLORIDA TODAY).  ?THE TRAFFIC CIRCLE AT THE INTERSECTION OF WICKHAM ROAD AND LAKE ANDREW DRIVE WAS BEGINNING TO HUM WITH THE RUSH OF FRIDAY EVENING TRAFFIC WHEN A LIGHT BLUE SEDAN HIT THE CURB AND CRASHED THROUGH SOME BUSHES INTO A RETENTION POND.?    ?SOME SAID THE CAR MADE A NOISE LIKE A ROARING FREIGHT TRAIN AS IT PLUNGED INTO THE WATER. A FEW SAID IT SHOT OFF LIKE A ROCKET.? END OF QUOTE.    IT IS TIME SOME ONE PAYS ATTENTION TO THE SERIOUSNESS THIS SAFETY PROBLEM.  IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE MERCURY THAT I HAVE TO PRESS THE BRAKE AND GAS PEDAL AT THE SAME TIME. AND EVEN IF YOU DID THE GAS PEDAL WOULD ONLY SLIGHTLY BE DEPRESSED.    I HAVE SEARCHED THE INTERNET AND FOUND NUMEROUS SIMILAR INCIDENTS WITH FORD MOTOR COMPANY VEHICLES. FORD MOTOR COMPANY SHOULD TELL THEIR DEALERS TO STOP THEIR SERVICE DEPARTMENTS FROM GIVING THEIR CUSTOMERS BULL CRAP AND DO THE SENSIBLE THING OF FINDING OUT WHAT IS REALLY WRONG.  *TR  ,R

I HAVE DONE SOME RESEARCH ON-LINE AND IT SOUNDS AS THOUGH CHEVY IS DOING NOTHING TO HELP THE SITUATION AND ITS HAPPENING WITH A LOT OF THE SAME YEAR VEHICLES!  I LOVE MY CAR THIS IS THE FIRST BIG ISSUE I AM SO SAD ABOUT IT.  I AM WORRIED ABOUT DRIVING WITH MY KIDS FROM WHAT I HAVE READ THE CAR WILL JUST TURN OFF!  NOT OKAY!!!

I SPILLED A SMALL AMOUNT OF OIL WHILE REFILLING (2 TABLESPOONS) AND NOTICED IT DROPPED ONTO THE MANIFOLD WHICH HAS SOME CREASES AND FOLDS IN IT THAT CAN CATCH THE OIL AND POOL IT.  EVEN THOUGH THE ENGINE HAD BEEN OFF FOR A FEW MINUTES IT WAS STILL HOT ENOUGH TO START SMOKING SLIGHTLY.      AFTER WIPING UP WHAT OIL I COULD WITH A RAG I RESTARTED THE ENGINE AND IT BEGAN SMOKING AGAIN WITHIN 20 SECONDS.  NO DOUBT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A FIRE IN THE ENGINE BAY WITHIN MINUTES HAD I NOT WIPED UP THE POOLED OIL FROM THE MANIFOLD. *TR,N
2009,2,222,102,0,0,0,0,ALTHOUGH THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN ACCIDENT YET DUE TO THE DESIGN OF THE CARS HEADLIGHTS AND TAIL LIGHTS (AND THE REMOVAL OF THE SIDE REPEATER LAMP FOR TURN SIGNAL INDICATION ON THE 2009 MODEL YEAR MALIBU) THERE IS NO VISIBLE TURN INDICATOR FOR OTHER DRIVERS TO SEE INDICATION OF A SIGNAL FROM THE CAR UNLESS OTHER DRIVERS ARE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF OR BEHIND THE CAR. FOR EXAMPLE IF A DRIVER IS SITTING AT A 4 WAY STOP OR LIKEWISE BECAUSE THE TURN SIGNAL DOES NOT WRAP AROUND THE FRONT OR BACK OF THE CAR DRIVERS TO THE LEFT AND RIGHT OF THE CAR CANNOT SEE THE TURN SIGNAL WHICH POSES A SAFETY HAZARD.  ON THE 2008 MALIBU THERE WAS A SIDE MARKER REPEATER LAMP ON THE FRONT QUARTER PANEL AND IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE 2009 MY.  I FEEL THAT THIS IS A LARGE SAFETY CONCERN AND THEY SHOULD BE PUT BACK ONTO THE CARS OR A REDESIGN OF THE HEADLAMP ASSY. *TR,N

THE CAR HAS ABOUT 36000 MILES NOW AND BOTH MY WIFE AND I HAVE HAD NUMEROUS INCIDENTS OF THIS   THE LAST RESULTED IN A TRAFFIC ACCIDENT IN PLANO TEXAS. THERE WERE 3 VEHICLES INVOLVED.THE PLANO TEXAS POLICE  OFFICER WHO DROVE THE CAR TO A SAFE LOCATION FOUND NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. EARLY IN MY CAREER I WAS A POLICE OFFICER WHOSE SPECIALTY WAS TRAFFIC INVESTIGATION. I HEARD SIMILAR  EXPLAINATIONS FOR ACCIDENT AND IN PERHAPS ONE FATAL ACCIDENT FOUND THAT A BRAKE LINE RUPUTURED CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCIDENT CAUSE.  THIS ACCELERATION WHEN BRAKING IN A SUDDEN STOP HAS HAPPENED TO BOTH MY WIFE AND I NUMEROUSE TIMES IN 36000 MILES AND I HAVE CHECKED THE BRAKES MORE THAN ONCE FINDING NO PROBLEM WITH THE BRAKES. I LEARNED  FROM A BODY SHOP EMPLOYEE AT SAM PACK WHO RELATED THAT HE HAD HEARD THIS SAME COMPLAINT BEFORE INCLUDINING FROM A FAMILY MEMBER. I BELIEVE THAT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING IS THAT DRIVERS WITH THIS FEATURE STEP ON BOTH THE GAS PEDAL AND THE BRAKE . IN A PANIC SITUATION I BELIEVE THAT DRIVERS ARE STEPPING ON BOTH PEDALS DUE TO SETTINGS THAT ALLOW  THE  GAS PEDAL TO OVERIDE THE BRAKE OR DIMINISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STOPPING DISTANCE. I CAN DUPLICATE THIS EFFECT AND THINK THAT IT IS A DESIGN FLAW THAT OCCURS THOUSANDS OF TIMES EACH DAY HAS SURELY RESULTED IN MANY ACCIDENTS AND POSSIBLY  DEATHS.I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A BRAKE PROBLEM AND SERVICE DEPARTMENTS DISMISS THE COMPLAINTS WHEN THEY FIND NO PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKES.

2010,1,1813,114,0,0,0,0,HELLO  I DON'T WANT TO WASTE TIME GOING INTO DETAIL WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER SOMEONE AT FORD WILL GET THIS...SO LET ME JUST SAY THAT I HAVE BEEN WITH FORD SINCE 1988 WHEN I BOUGHT A BRONCO.  IN 1992 I BOUGHT AN EDDIE BAUER EXPLORER AND HAVE HAD EXPLORERS UP UNTIL THIS PAST YEAR WHEN I BOUGHT YOUR CROSSOVER THE EDGE.  IT IS A NICE CAR RIDES NICELY BUT HAS A LOT OF ROAD NOISE THAT I DID NOT EXPERIENCE WITH THE EXPLORERS.  MY BIGGEST CONCERN/PROBLEM IS THAT THE SPEEDOMETER IS TUCKED DEEP INTO THE RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE DASH AND CAN NOT BE SEEN DURING MOST OF THE TIME WHILE DRIVING.  SEEING IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE LIGHT IS COMING IN.  I HAVE CAUGHT MYSELF GOING 80 AND NOT REALIZING IT SINCE THE DIAL IS JUST ONE BIG BLACK CIRCLE.  DURING RAIN STORMS THE LIGHTS COME ON THE RED INDICATORS ARE LIT BUT THE SPEED NUMBERS ARE LOST IN THE DARK.  THIS I BELIEVE IS A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE.  I'VE BEEN TO THE DEALER AND THEY SAY THAT THERE IS NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE.  I HAVE NEVER HAD A CAR WHERE THE CRUCIAL SPEED DIAL CAN NOT BE SEEN.  I THINK THAT YOUR FORD ENGINEERS GOOFED ON THIS DESIGN.  THE TACH ON THE LEFT SIDE IS ALWAYS VISIBLE....BUT NOT THE SPEEDOMETER.  CAN YOU HELP WITH THIS PROBLEM?  THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. *TR  ,N

THE CONTACT HAS EXPERIENCED DISCOMFORT WHILE DRIVING EVEN WHEN HE ATTEMPTED TO REST HIS SHOULDERS AGAINST THE BACK OF THE SEAT. THE VEHICLE WAS PURCHASED SEVEN DAYS AGO WITHOUT HIM TEST DRIVING IT. THE DEALER ADVISED THE CONTACT THAT THEY WERE UNABLE TO MAKE ANY REPAIRS SINCE ALL OF 2010 FORD EXPLORERS WERE DESIGNED WITH THAT TYPE OF HEADREST. THE DEALER RECOMMENDED THAT THE CONTACT ROTATE THE HEADREST; HOWEVER THE DRIVER STATED THAT THE HEADREST WOULD NOT SERVE IT?S PURPOSE. THE VIN WAS UNKNOWN.  THE FAILURE MILEAGE WAS 100.,N
2010,1,244,117,0,0,0,0,THE HEAD REST ON MY 2010 FORD EXPLORER LEANS SO FAR FORWARD THAT IT FORCES MY HEAD DOWN AND FORWARD. THE DEALER CANNOT ADJUST IT SO THAT YOU CAN SIT NORMALLY. THE ONLY RECOURSE IS TO REMOVE THE HEAD REST. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DRIVE WITH IT AND REMOVING IT REMOVES ANY PROTECTION. *TR,N
2010,1,417,117,0,0,0,0,"THE HEAD REST ON MY NEW 2010 FORD FOCUS (NOT A FUSION AS NOTED) PROTRUDES FORWARD BEYOND THE TOP OF THE SEAT CAUSING MY HEAD AND NECK TO BE PUSHED FORWARD INTO AN UNNATURAL POSITION WITH MY SPINE.  THIS IN TURN IS A VERY UNSAFE DRIVING POSITION TO BE IN DUE TO MISALIGNMENT OF MY HEAD NECK AND SPINE AND CAUSES UNNECESSARY FATIGUE NECK PAIN AND HEADACHE .  IT IS ESPECIALLY AWKWARD AND DIFFICULT TO DRIVE AND LOOK TOWARD THE RIGHT REAR OF THE VEHICLE WHILE BEING FORCED INTO A CROOK NECK"" POSITION BY THE FORWARD PROTRUDING HEAD REST.  I PURCHASED TO VEHICLE NEW UNDER THE CASH FOR CLUNKERS PROGRAM AND WITHOUT DRIVING IT.  THIS WAS A BIG MISTAKE AS I GOT MYSELF INTO AN APPARENT UNSAFE VEHICLE.  AFTER DRIVING IT FOR ONLY 40 MILES I EXPERIENCED NECK PAIN.  MY INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT THE FORWARD PROTRUDING HEAD REST WAS THE PROBLEM.  I PROMPTLY NOTIFIED THE DEALER WHERE I BOUGHT IT AND WAS ADVISED BY MY SALES PERSON THAT SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE HAVE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT THESE HEAD RESTS.  I THEN NOTIFIED FORD MOTOR COMPANY CUSTOMER SERVICES OF THE PROBLEM AND WAS ADVISED ""THE HEAD RESTS ARE MADE TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS"".  I INDICATED THAT THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE AND SUGGESTED THAT THEY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BEFORE THEY HAVE ANOTHER FIRESTONE TIRE TYPE OF PROBLEM TO DEAL WITH.  THE COMPANY REP. THEN PROCEEDED TO HANG UP ON ME.     AS A REMEDY TO MY COMPLAINT. THE DEALER (SERVICE MANAGER) REMOVED THE HEAD RESTS FROM THE FRONT SEATS OF MY NEW CAR AND SUGGESTED THAT I ""GO TO A SALVAGE (JUNK) YARD AND TRY TO GET REPLACEMENT HEAD RESTS THAT DO NOT CAUSE THE PROBLEM"".  I REMINDED HIM THAT I HAD JUST TURNED IN A '93 AEROSTAR THAT DID NOT HAVE THE PROBLEM AND HE REPLIED ""WE JUST SELL THE CARS - WE DON'T BUILD THEM"".   WITH THE HEAD RESTS REMOVED I NOW HAVE NO PROTECTION FROM WHIPLASH WHICH IS ANOTHER SAFETY PROBLEM.     I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE NHTSA INVESTIGATE THESE HEAD RESTS (ASAP) TO PREVENT INJURY DEATH OR PROPERTY DAMAGE.  A RECALL IS NEEDED HERE.     THANK YOU *TR""",N
2010,1,417,117,0,0,0,0,MY COMPLAINT IS NOT SPECIFIC TO ANY PARTICULAR AUTOMOBILE BUT INSTEAD CONCERNS THE FRONT SEAT HEADRESTS IN MANY LATE-MODEL VEHICLES.  THESE HEADRESTS ARE ANGLED TOO FAR FORWARD AND ARE CAUSING DRIVERS AND FRONT SEAT PASSENGERS TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT NECK BACK AND SHOULDER DISCOMFORT.  THIS CHANGE IN HEADREST DESIGN IS TOO EXTREME.  ON THE INTERNET I HAVE READ THAT MANY CAR OWNERS ARE REMOVING THE HEADRESTS AND REPLACING THEM WITH THE FORWARD SURFACE FACING REARWARD.  OTHERS ARE REMOVING THESE HEADRESTS ALTOGETHER.  IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT WHIPLASH INJURIES MAY OCCUR LESS FREQUENTLY WITH THE NEW STANDARDS HOWEVER THE DISCOMFORT EXPERIENCED WHILE DRIVING FOR EVEN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME IS CAUSING PEOPLE TO HAVE HEADACHES AND NECK AND BACK SYMPTOMS THAT MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO RELATED CHRONIC CONDITIONS. *TR,N

2012,9,275,118,0,0,0,0,1/23/2016 8:02 AM     I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MY WIFE WHO WAS DRIVING HER 2012 HYUNDAI SONATA ON THE I-95 IN SOUTH FLORIDA ON THE WAY TO WORK GOING APPROXIMATELY 70 MPH WHEN SHE WENT TO ACCELERATE TO OVERTAKE A CAR DRIVING SLOWER. ALL THE LIGHTS ON THE DASHBOARD WENT ON AND THE CAR COMPLETELY LOST ACCELERATION POWER AND THE  SPEED DROPPED ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 40 MPH. WHEN THE SPEED REACHED 40 MPH SHE COULD NOT ACCELERATE ANYMORE AND HENCE QUICKLY PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD (UPON MY REQUEST). DUE TO THE HEAVY TRAFFIC SHE WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY NOT TO GET INTO AN ACCIDENT. WHEN I ARRIVED TO SWITCH CARS WITH HER THE CAR STARTED FINE AND ACCELERATED APPROPRIATELY. I TOOK IT STRAIGHT TO THE HYUNDAI DEALERSHIP WHO AFTER RUNNING DIAGNOSTICS CAME UP THE FOLLOWING:  NO CODES STORED IN MEMORY AND NO SIGNS OF WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE CAR TO ACT LIKE THIS. THEY RECOMMENDED A THROTTLE BODY CLEANING WHICH IS CURRENTLY BEING COMPLETED (I AM WRITING THIS FROM DELRAY BEACH HYUNDAI). THEY STATED THE THROTTLE BODY STICKING MAY BE THE CAUSE BUT WENT ON TO ADMIT THEY REALLY HAD NO IDEA AS DIAGNOSTICS GAVE THEM NO INFORMATION. AFTER  THIS INCIDENT WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THE CAR IS NO LONGER SAFE TO DRIVE AND THE FACT THE DEALERSHIP HAS BEEN UNABLE TO COME UP WITH ANY CAUSE IS EVEN MORE OF A CONCERN.,N

I WAS PULLING INTO A PARKING LOT WHEN I STARTED HEARING A NOISE FROM THE HOOD. I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND RESTARTED IT THE NOISE WAS STILL THERE AND BECAME LOUDER. THEN SMOKE STARTED COMING OUT OF THE HOOD. I TURNED OFF THE CAR AND WAITED FOR THE SMOKE TO SUBSIDE WHICH WAS ABOUT 40 MINUTES. THEN I OPENED THE HOOD AND AND THE SMELL OF BURNT WAS VERY STRONG. THE CAR WOULD NOT START AFTER THAT. WE HAD IT TOWED TO OUR MECHANIC AND HE CONFIRMED THE ALTERNATOR HAD CAUGHT FIRE. HE COULD NOT FIX ANYTHING BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL COMPONENTS IN THE CAR WHERE ACTING UP AND HE DOES NOT KNOW THE SYSTEM. HE ADVISED US ABOUT THE ALTERNATOR RECALL P60 AND SO I CALLED CHRYSLER AND THEY WERE ADAMANT THAT MY CAR DOES NOT HAVE ANY RECALLS FOR THE ALTERNATOR. HOWEVER ALL SYMPTOMS OF THIS RECALL P60 WERE PRESENT IN MY CAR. WE TOOK IT TO FIRESTONE AND THEY REFERRED US TO THE DEALER BECAUSE THEY CONFIRMED THE COMPUTER WAS ALSO DAMAGED AND THEY SAID THAT ONLY THE DEALER COULD HELP WITH THAT. I CALLED THE DEALER AS WELL AND THEY SAID THERE IS NO WARRANTY ON THE ALTERNATOR COMPUTER OR ANY OF THE COMPONENTS THE OTHER MECHANICS HAVE CONFIRMED FAILED IN THE CAR. CHRYSLER WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE VEHICLE HAS THE SAME ALTERNATOR ISSUE UNDER RECALL P60 AND NOW WE ARE LEFT WITH AN EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE REPAIR CAR RENTAL.

2012,1,1360,111,0,0,0,0,"THE AFFECTED PART"" IS THE TRANSMISSION.  THE ""INCIDENT"" THAT OCCURRED IS A RECURRING PROBLEM WITH THE POWER SHIFT TRANSMISSION.  WHEN THE CAR'S AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION IS IN ""DRIVE"" OR ""REVERSE"" AND THE DRIVER TAKES HIS FOOT OFF THE BRAKE OR ACCELERATOR THE CAR ACTS AS THOUGH IT IS IN NEUTRAL FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND.  IF THE CAR IS ON A HILL THE CAR WILL ROLL DOWNHILL DURING THAT BRIEF PERIOD WHEN THE BRAKE/ACCELERATOR IS NOT APPLIED.  ALTHOUGH THIS HAS NOT CAUSED AN ACCIDENT DRIVING THE CAR YET I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL SAFETY HAZARDS THIS COULD CAUSE.  IF THE CAR IS STOPPED ON A HILL AND THE DRIVER LETS OFF THE BRAKE/ACCELERATOR DESPITE ANY ACTION OF THE DRIVER THE CAR MAY ROLL DOWNHILL AND HIT A CAR BEHIND IT.  ADDITIONALLY PARALLEL PARKING IS VERY DIFFICULT BECAUSE THE TRANSMISSION REMAINS IN NEUTRAL FOR THAT 1 SECOND AND EVEN ON A SLIGHT HILL THE CAR WILL ROLL.      I TOOK THE CAR IN TO MY FORD DEALERSHIP TO ALERT THEM OF THIS PROBLEM AND THEY TOLD ME THAT IS NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE TRANSMISSION.  I HAVE NEVER DRIVEN A CAR THAT WHEN IN DRIVE ROLLED BACKWARDS WHILE I WAS ON A HILL.  IF THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE NORMAL FUNCTIONING OF THE TRANSMISSION THEN THE TRANSMISSION HAS A FAULTY DESIGN.    I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE HAZARDS THIS TRANSMISSION MAY CAUSE SINCE IF A CAR IS CLOSE BEHIND ME WHILE I AM PARKED ON A HILL MY CAR MAY ROLL BACK AND HIT IT OUTSIDE OF MY CONTROL.  IN A TYPICAL MANUAL TRANSMISSION CAR THE DRIVER IS ABLE TO CONTROL THIS ROLLING WITH THE CLUTCH AND BRAKE.  BECAUSE THIS IS AN AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION THE DRIVER IS NOT ABLE TO CONTROL THE ROLLING.  *TR""",N

REGARDLESS I'VE BEGUN TO EXPERIENCE THE SAME ISSUES 2011 MODEL YEAR OWNERS REPORT. I'VE OWNED THE CAR LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AND WITH LESS THAN 200 MILES ON THE CAR AT A STOP LIGHT THE TRANSMISSION FAILED TO ENGAGE INTO FIRST GEAR FULLY. THIS RESULTS IN A GRINDING COMING FROM THE TRANSMISSION. NEARLY REAR ENDED VEHICLE WAS AT A LIGHT AT THE END OF A FREEWAY RAMP AND WAS UNABLE TO ACCELERATE UNTIL THE CAR WAS PLACED INTO NEUTRAL AND RE-SHIFTED TO 1ST. 1ST TO 2ND AND 2ND TO 3RD SHIFTS TEND TO BE HARD ROUGH OR CLUNKY. ON OCCASION SHIFTS TO 5TH EXHIBIT A CLUNKY SENSATION AS WELL. AT 295 MILES WAS UNABLE TO SHIFT INTO 2ND GEAR YOU COULD HEAR THE SYNCHROS WINDING UP IN THE TRANSMISSION DURING THE ATTEMPT. LIKEWISE MOVING BACK TO FIRST EVEN AT SPEEDS OF LESS THAN 5MPH IN THIS INSTANCE RESULTED IN A ROUGH ENGAGEMENT AND SYNCHRO WHINE FROM THE TRANNY. DRIVING IN 2ND GEAR AT 20MPH AND PUSHING THE CLUTCH IN TO COAST RESULTS IN A RATTLING NOISE INTERMITTENTLY. THIS RATTLING JUST STARTED WITHIN THE LAST 50 MILES OF DRIVING. THE BUILD DATE ON THE VEHICLE WAS 3/31/2011. I'VE NOT YET REPORTED  THIS ISSUE TO MY FORD DEALER BUT INTEND TO SHORTLY! VERY VERY WORRIED AT OVER $42000 THIS IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE VEHICLE I'VE EVER PURCHASED AND AM GRAVELY CONCERNED I MAY HAVE A LEMON ON MY HANDS. MY PREVIOUS MUSTANG WITH A 5 SPD MANUAL NEVER EXHIBITED THESE TENDENCIES. FORD MUST RESOLVE THE ISSUES THE MT-82 6 SPEED TRANSMISSION IMMEDIATELY OR REPLACE IT WITH A PROPERLY DESIGNED ALTERNATE UNIT.

A TRANSMISSION THAT IS GRINDING GEARS / GETTING LOCKED OUT OF GEARS AFTER A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILES CAN'T LAST FOR WHAT YOU WOULD NORMALLY EXPECT A TRANSMISSION TO LAST FOR.

I WOULD HAVE TO BE STRANDED UNTIL HELP ARRIVED AND WHAT IF AT NIGHT AND I CAN;T GET A NEW TIRE UNTIL THE NEXT DAY. THIS I FEEL IS A SAFETY MATTER FOR THE MOTORIST. A MINI SPARE SHOULD BE STANDARD ON ALL CARS. YOU NEVER KNOW WHO MIGHT STOP WHILE YOU ARE STRANDED AND ATTACK OR ROB YOU. EVEN THE POLICE CAN'T HELP YOU WITH NO SPARE TIRE AND YOU HAVE TO SIT IN A DANGEROUS PLACE UNTIL A TOW TRUCK ARRIVED. I COMPLAINED TO FORD AND THEIR REPLY WAS BUY A GT V-8 MODEL WHICH DOES COME WITH A SPARE TIRE AND WHEEL. I FEEL THIS IS A SAFETY COMPLAINT AND THAT FORD SHOULD SUPPLY A MINI SPARE TIRE AND JACK AT LITTLE OR NO COST. THANK YOU.    UPDATED 08/31/11 *BF    ,N

2014,5,960,103,0,0,0,0,BRAKE FAILURE AND CAR ACCELERATES DURING PERIODS OF BRAKE FAILURE.    A WEEK AFTER TAKING DELIVERY OF THIS NEW CAR WITH AROUND 470 MILES ON THE ODE METER IT WAS NOTICED THAT DURING PERIODS OF GENTLE BRAKING THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL AND THE CAR WOULD ACCELERATED DURING THE SHORT PERIODS THE BRAKES WOULD FAIL. THE FIRST OCCURRENCE WAS NOTICED AT AROUND 30 MPH IN STEADY URBAN TRAFFIC. THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL AGAIN ABOUT 10 MIN LATER IN SIMILAR TRAFFIC. DURING THESE 2 FAILURES THE BRAKES APPEARED TO FAIL FOR AROUND A QUARTER OF A SECOND. ABOUT 1/2 AN HOUR LATER IN STEADY FREEWAY TRAFFIC OF 55 TO 60 MPH AT AROUND 3.30 PM GENTLE BRAKING WAS NEEDED AND THE BRAKES FAILED AND THE CAR ACCELERATED FOR ABOUT A PERIOD OF ONE TO ONE AND A HALF SECONDS. I WAS VERY CLOSE TO RAMMING THE CAR IN FRONT. DURING THE PERIODS OF FAILURE THE BRAKE PEDAL REMAINS FIRM AND SOLID IT IS AS IF THE BRAKES ARE ELECTRONICALLY SWITCHED OFF AND THEN ELECTRONICALLY SWITCHED ON AGAIN. DURING THE PERIODS OF FAILURES THE APPLICATION OF ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON THE BRAKE PEDAL DOES NOT STOP THE CAR ACCELERATING. THE FASTER THE SPEED THE LONGER THE PERIOD THAT THE BRAKES APPEAR TO FAIL. IT WAS A PRETTY SCARY EXPERIENCE.  THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN YOU APPLY THE BRAKES IN ANY CAR THE DRIVER NEEDS TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE CAR WILL SLOW DOWN AND STOP SAFELY  THE LAST THING A CAR SHOULD DO IS ACCELERATE WHEN THE BRAKE PEDAL IS PRESSED IT TOTALLY DESTROYS THE SAFE BRAKING 3 SECOND RULE.  THE MANUFACTURE HAS DETERMINED THAT THE TRANSMISSION SOFTWARE IS THE PROBLEM AND IT COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR TO REWRITE THE SOFTWARE. THIS IN MY OPINION IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND ALL 2014 JEEP PATRIOT AND COMPASS WITH 6 SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSIONS SHOULD BE TAKE OFF THE ROAD.  NHTSA ARE WELCOME TO A TEST DRIVE THESE BRAKE FAILURE/ACCELERATION ISSUES OCCUR EVERY TIME THE CAR IS DRIVEN. *TR,R

2016,29,1880,103,0,0,0,0,THERE IS A SERIOUS DESIGN FLAW/SAFETY HAZARD WITH THE WAY THE BAR ATTACHED TO THE BRAKE PEDAL IS STRUCTURED.  WHEN THE VEHICLE IS IN MOTION AND I NEED TO BRAKE THE TIP OF MY SHOE MAKES CONTACT WITH THE SKINNY METAL BAR ATTACHED TO THE BRAKE PEDAL.  IN OTHER WORDS THE ONLY WAY TO BRAKE IS TO BEND MY SHOE FAR ENOUGH FOR IT TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL.  THIS CAUSES VERY UNEVEN JERKY AND ERRATIC BRAKING.  IN MANY CASES I HAVE NEARLY REAR-ENDED THE VEHICLE IN FRONT OF ME BECAUSE MY SHOE IS NOT FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO MAKE FAST CONTACT WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL. I HAVE SEVERAL PICTURES WHICH CLEARLY SHOW THIS DESIGN FLAW.,N
