I FOUND OUT LATER THAT THERE WAS A LEAK AND IT IS $1200. A WEEK AFTER THAT THE CAR WOULD NOT START THE DEALER PICKED THE CAR UP AND SAID THAT THE BATTERY WAS DEAD BECAUSE I LEFT THE RADIO ON, IT HAS HAPPENED OVER 30 TIMES, NOT TRUE THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG. I HAVE REPLACED TIRES AT LEAST SIX TIMES. TIRES COMPLETELY SEPARATE. I WAS DRIVING AND CAR SLOWED DOWN ON FREEWAY AND I WAS ALMOST HIT, I PULLED OVER AND IT STOPPED AND DID IT AGAIN AND I HAD TO PUSH THE TRACTION CONTROL BUTTON, ALMOST COST ME MY LIFE! IT NOW HAPPENS WHEN I HIT A BUMP. WHEN I TURN THE CAR MAKES A EXTREMELY LOUD NOISE, (EMBARRASSING) I WAS TOLD IT IS A BALL JOINT AND CAN CATCH ON FIRE. ENGINE LIGHT HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON AND IS NOW BLINKING AND THE CAR SHAKES AND HESITATES. I HAD TO PAY TO GET THE BRAKES FIXED 2 MONTHS AFTER PURCHASING. RADIO TURNS ON FOR NO REASON AND RUNS BATTERY DOWN. I WAS TOLD I HAVE TWO LEAKS IN MY SHOCKS AND IT IS $1800 EACH. WHEN I BACK UP AND TURN THE STEERING WHEEL VIBRATES. I CAN'T EVEN USE THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER TO CHARGE MY CELL BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WORK AND HAS BEEN REPLACED TWICE. THE REMOTE JUST STOP WORKING AND I WAS CHARGED $100 TO RECONFIGURE. THE BRAKES ACT FUNNY, CAN'T EVEN EXPLAIN IT. THIS CAR IS UNREAL, A COMPLETE PIECE OF JUNK. I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER HALF THE STUFF I HAVE ENDURED AND THE MONEY I HAVE SPENT. *NM', 'N'

I WAS DRIVING AND HAD STOPPED AT A STOP SIGN AND ATTEMPTED TO PROCEED AND THE CAR INCHED OUT AND JUST STOPPED..   I ALMOST HAD AN ACCIDENT AT THAT TIME BECAUSE THE CAR WOULD NOT PROCEED IN THE INTERSECTION..  A MESSAGE ON THE DASH READ THAT THE "TRANS DRIVE SAFE DRIVE MODERATELY" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT.  WHEN I GOT TO MY DESTINATION I TURNED THE CARE OFF.  THE NEXT TIME I STARTED THE CAR THE MESSAGE WAS GONE UNTIL ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER.  I LOOKED UP ANY INFORMATION THAT I COULD FIND ON BMW TRANSMISSIONS AND FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS CONSUMERS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED OR ARE EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEMS AND ARE DESPERATE FOR HELP.  THE MAIN MALFUNCTION AT THIS POINT IS THAT THE CAR  IS SLUGGISH AT TAKE OFF AND DEFINITELY WILL NOT GO INTO REVERSE AND THE DEALER HAS TOLD ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS SHOT. DRIVING THIS VEHICLE IS VERY DANGEROUS AND AT ANY TIME, UNKNOWINGLY THE TRANSMISSIONS ON THESE CARS CAN FAIL.  PEOPLE DRIVING THESE BMW'S WITH FAULTY TRANSMISSIONS SHOULD BE MADE AWARE OF THE PROBLEM BEFORE SOME ONE IS SERIOUSLY HURT.  I AM STILL PAYING ON THIS AUTOMOBILE IT'S FOUR YEARS OLD AND IT HAS FAILED WITH A MAJOR PROBLEM.  PLEASE GO TO CONSUMER AFFAIRS ON THE INTERNET AND YOU WILL SEE THE NUMEROUS PEOPLE WHO HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINT ABOUT THIS EXPENSIVE AUTOMOBILE THAT HAS FAILED AND CONSUMERS HAVE TO PAY THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO GET REPAIRS DONE.  MY CAR IS IN THE SHOP AS WE SPEAK, I HAVEN'T RECEIVED A QUOTE ON THE COST AS OF YET, BUT THE MECHANIC HAS ADVISED ME THAT THE TRANSMISSION IS NO GOOD.  *TR', 'N'

THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY HAVE NOT NOTED THE X3 WITH SPORT SEATS BEING PART OF THE RECALL, ALTHOUGH ALL OTHER MODELS WITH THE SAME SEAT HAS BEEN NOTED.   I JUST HAD MY X3 SERVICED, AND ALSO ASK THEM TO REPAIR THE SEAT MAT THAT HAS FAILED, BUT THE DEALER STATED THAT THIS SEAT WAS NOT LISTED, BUT DID HAVE THE COMMON FAILURE THAT HAS BROUGHT FORWARD THE RECALL.   I AM ASKING THAT NHTSA NOTIFY BMW AND INSIST THAT THEY HAVE LEFT OUT THE X3 WITH SPORT SEATS. *TR', 'N'

2003, 'BMW', '325CI', 'FUEL SYSTEM, GASOLINE:DELIVERY', 'N', 'N', 0, 0, 'THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE/ENGINE MANAGEMENT CONTROL MODULE.  WHENEVER ACCELERATING FROM A STOP, THE CAR LUNGES FORWARD, THEN STOPS AND GOES INTO A CYCLE WHERE IT DOES THIS "BUCKING" ACTION A FEW TIMES.  THE CAR IS 2 YEARS OLD, BUT HAS ONLY DONE THIS FOR THE PAST YEAR.  I'VE ATTEMPTED TO HAVE THIS REPAIRED BY BMW- HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM FOR THE LAST EIGHT (8) MONTHS WITH NO RESULT.  MY FAMILY REFUSES TO RIDE IN THE CAR BECAUSE THE JERKING MOTION MAKES THEM SICK.  A BMW FIELD REPRESENTATIVE KNOWS ABOUT THE PROBLEM BUT REFUSED TO DIAGNOSE OR REPAIR THE PROBLEM.  I HIRED AN INDEPENDENT MECHANIC THAT WAS ABLE TO TRACE THE PROBLEM TO THE ELECTRONIC THROTTLE CONTROL, BUT DOES NOT POSSESS THE BMW SOFTWARE OR EQUIPMENT TO REPAIR IT.  NOW IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE DANGEROUS TO DRIVE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS GETTING PROGRESSIVELY WORSE.  IT'S IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE LEFT TURNS AT INTERSECTIONS SINCE THE CAR JERKS FORWARD AND STOPS.  A FEW TIMES I WAS ALMOST HIT BY ONCOMING TRAFFIC DUE TO THIS.  ', 'N'
