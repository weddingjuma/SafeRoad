OVER THE COURSE OF 3 YEARS THE DEALER HAS REPLACED NUMEROUS SENSORS WIRING HARNESS PIECES AND SEVERAL OF THE AIRBAG UNITS (ESP. THE SEAT AIRBAGS).  THIS IS REPORTED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MINI COOPER FAILURES AND HAS PLAGUED THESE CARS FOR ALL MODEL YEARS IN PRODUCTION.

THE CRACK BEGAN UNDER THE TRIM MOVED UP TURNED A FEW INCHES UP AND THEN SPREAD TOWARD THE PASSENGER SIDE. TWO WEEKS LATER I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR IT'S FIRST SCHEDULED OIL SERVICE WHERE I ASKED THE SERVICE ADVISOR PETER WARK OF MINI OF THE MAIN LINE IN BALA CYNWYD PA ABOUT THE WINDSHIELD. HE PROCEEDED TO TAKE THE POINT OF A SMALL SCREWDRIVER AND RUN IT ALONG THE CRACK. ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH ABOVE THE TRIM AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR A ROCK TO HIT THE SCREWDRIVER CAUGHT A SMALL NICK IN THE GLASS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A GRAIN OF SAND. HE INFORMED ME THAT THAT NICK WAS CAUSED BY A ROCK WHICH CAUSED THE CRACK WHICH WOULD NOT BE COVERED UNDER THE WARRANTY. HE THEN TOLD ME ABOUT HOW THE PROCESS THEY USE OF GLUEING THE GLASS ON CAUSES THE ENTIRE BOTTOM FEW INCHES OF GLASS TO BECOME VERY WEAK AND THAT ANYTHING HITTING THE GLASS IN THAT AREA EVEN A TINY ROCK WOULD CRACK THE GLASS. I FOUND THIS TO BE UNACCEPTABLE SO I CALLED THE MINI CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AT 1-866-ASK-MINI. I SPOKE TO A MARTY"" WHO MERELY REPEATED OVER AND OVER THAT HE WAS ""SORRY THEY MADE THAT DETERMINATION BUT A ROCK CHIP IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY."" AFTER RECEIVING NO HELP FROM THE COMPANY I HAD THE DEALER REPLACE THE GLASS. I FEEL THAT THE REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED BECAUSE THE WAY THEY MANUFACTURE AND ATTACH THE GLASS CAUSES WEAKNESS AND THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT WHICH IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR SUPPLYING A CUSTOMER WITH A WARRANTY. I HAVE VIDEO AND PHOTOS OF THE CRACK AND NICK AS WELL AS RECEIPTS FOR THE REPAIR. THE CRACK WAS FIRST NOTICED AND SPREAD AUGUST 12 2004 AND MY SERVICE APPOINTMENT WAS AUGUST 24 2004.*AK""",N
