HONESTLY IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL IF I RAN OVER A POTHOLE OR IF I HIT A ROCK BECAUSE THE LOUD NOISE AND MY SHOCK DOMINATED THE MOMENT. THANKFULLY I WAS COMMUTING ALONE THAT DAY AND NOBODY GOT HURT. I STOPPED THE CAR TO INSPECT IT AND I COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING. I FILLED A CLAIM WITH HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE AND TOOK THE CAR TO THE NEAREST HONDA CENTER FOR A DIAGNOSIS ($120). HONDA CUSTOMER SERVICE REQUESTED THAT ONE OF THEIR FIELD ENGINEERS INSPECTED THE CAR. AFTER HIS INSPECTION HE DETERMINED THAT AN IMPACT CAUSED THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY. WHEN I REQUESTED TO SEE THE IMPACT SIGNS THEY POINTED A SCRATCH ON THE FRAME RAIL. THEY SAID THAT THE SCRATCH SEEMS MINOR ONLY BECAUSE IT HAPPENED ON THE TOUGHEST PART OF THE CAR THE FRAME RAIL. THAT SCRATCH IS ALMOST UNDERNEATH THE PASSENGER'S SIDE SENSOR. I ASKED FOR MORE INFORMATION SUCH AS THE THRESHOLD WHEN AN AIRBAG DEPLOYS HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT THIS SCRATCH WAS NOT THERE BEFORE ETC. THEY DIDN'T ANSWER MY QUESTIONS INSTEAD THEY TOLD ME THAT THE SCRATCH WAS FRESH"". I'M ATTACHING THE PICTURES OF THE SCRATCH ON THE FRAME RAIL. IT'S NOT VERY OBVIOUS BUT LOOK AT THE SILVER SCRAPE.  I DECIDED TO TAKE MY CAR TO MY INSURANCE (PROGRESSIVE). THEY WERE BAFFLED WITH WHAT THEY SAW AND THEY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SUCH SCRATCH WOULD CAUSE THE AIRBAGS TO DEPLOY. THE ESTIMATOR HELPING ME WASN'T SURE IF THEY'LL COVER IT. HE'LL ELEVATE THE ISSUE AND CALL ME ON MONDAY. HONDA DOESN'T RECOGNIZE THIS AS A DEFECT SINCE THEY FOUND A SCRATCH.

SEVERAL MORNINGS WHILE BACKING OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY THE CAR'S BRAKE PRESSURE DID NOT EMPLOY THE BRAKES IN THE NORMAL SAFE FASHION.  WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE DRIVEWAY HE APPLIED THE BRAKES THE PEDAL WAS HARD AND NONCOMPLIANT (THE CAR DID NOT STOP OR SLOW DOWN) UNTIL HE APPLIED THE BRAKE PEDAL VERY HARD.  WHILE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DRIVEWAY RIGHT BEFORE EXITING ONTO THE SIDEWALK THE BRAKES BEGAN WORKING AS NORMAL.  THIS SITUATION HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS WARMED UP FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES HE TAPPED THE BRAKES UPON ROLLING BACKWARD A COUPLE OF FEET OR SO TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE WORKING PROPERLY.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.  THIS SAFETY PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT.   I LEFT MY CAR OVERNIGHT WITH A LOCAL DEALER TO HAVE A MECHANIC GO THROUGH THE BRAKE SYSTEM BASED UPON THIS SAFETY ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC AND THE SERVICE CONSULTANT MY BRAKES ARE FINE NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS DETECTED MY CAR IS PERFECT.  BASED UPON THE SERIOUSNESS OF THIS ISSUE AND THE LACK OF RESOLVE FROM THE DEALERSHIP I AM FILING THIS COMPLAINT.     I HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH MY CAR WHICH I HAVE REPORTED TO THE DEALER AND RECEIVED SERVICE FOR ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS.  THIS PROBLEM IS NOT SAFETY RELATED BUT MAY HAVE SOME CONNECTION TO THE BRAKES NOT ENGAGING ON SEVERAL OCCASSIONS.  WHEN TAKING OFF FROM A COLD START AND TRAVELING BETWEEN 7-10 MPH THE CAR MAKES A THUMP NOISE WHICH ORIGINATES FROM THE DRIVER'S SIDE.  NOT ONLY CAN YOU HEAR THE NOISE BUT YOU CAN FEEL IT THROUGH THE ACCELERATION PEDAL.  I WAS TOLD BY ONE DEALERSHIP THE PROBLEM IS BRAKE RELATED AND THERE IS NO FIX.

I GRABBED THE FRAME AND IT JUST CRUMBLED. WITH THE NEW SUBFRAME AND TUNE SHE RUNS LIKE NEW EVEN AT 200K.    LATER I DID MORE RESEARCH LATER AND FOUND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. I GOT THE CAR UP ON A FRIEND'S LIFT AND FOUND THE A/C DRAIN HOSE. IT WAS HIGH UP IN THE CAR AND REALLY SHORT! IT POINTED DIRECTLY AT THE SUBFRAME. I SIMPLY REPLACED THE HOSE CLAMPED IT ON THEN TIED THE END TO A THINGY FURTHER DOWN SO THAT THE OPENING POINTED AT THE GROUND. LIKE $2 IN PARTS AND 20 MINUTES AND I'M AN AMATEUR. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT HONDA NEVER OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS DESIGN DEFECT. I GET THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR SUBFRAME REPLACEMENTS - THEY'RE A BUSINESS YADDA YADDA. BUT IT'S SUCH A BASIC OVERSIGHT WITH AN EASY SOLUTION. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DILIGENCE ON THEIR PART WOULD HAVE SAVED ME OVER A THOUSAND BUCKS. SUBFRAME RUST IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE.

WHILE DESCENDING HILLS I HAVE NEARLY LOST CONTROL AS THE CAR ACCELERATES WHILE CRUISE CONTROL HAS DISENGAGED  I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR WHEN I MUST TAKE OFF HARD ESPECIALLY WHEN CROSSING A BUSY STREET.  WHEN LAUNCHING HARD THE CLUTCH WILL SLIP EXCESSIVELY.  THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE; IT WILL ONLY BURN THE CLUTCH CREATING A LARGE CLOUD OF SMOKE.  IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH GEAR I SWITCH TOO OR HOW MUCH THROTTLE I APPLY; THE CLUTCH WILL NOT GRIP UNTIL IT COOLS DOWN.  I HAVE NEARLY BEEN HIT NUMEROUS TIMES BECAUSE OF THIS.

I FOUND THIS TO BE UNACCEPTABLE SO I CALLED THE MINI CUSTOMER SERVICE LINE AT 1-866-ASK-MINI. I SPOKE TO A MARTY"" WHO MERELY REPEATED OVER AND OVER THAT HE WAS ""SORRY THEY MADE THAT DETERMINATION BUT A ROCK CHIP IS NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY."" AFTER RECEIVING NO HELP FROM THE COMPANY I HAD THE DEALER REPLACE THE GLASS. I FEEL THAT THE REPAIR SHOULD BE COVERED BECAUSE THE WAY THEY MANUFACTURE AND ATTACH THE GLASS CAUSES WEAKNESS AND THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED A MANUFACTURER'S DEFECT WHICH IS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR SUPPLYING A CUSTOMER WITH A WARRANTY. I HAVE VIDEO AND PHOTOS OF THE CRACK AND NICK AS WELL AS RECEIPTS FOR THE REPAIR. THE CRACK WAS FIRST NOTICED AND SPREAD AUGUST 12 2004 AND MY SERVICE APPOINTMENT WAS AUGUST 24 2004.*AK""",U
