ESPECIALLY SOME ENGINE FIRE OCCURRED TWO MONTHS LATER AFTER OIL CHANGE BASED ON COMPLAINT CASE. HONDA SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM. HONDA SHOULD NOT JUST LAY THE RESPONSIBILITY DOWN TO TECHNICIAN. WHY ONLY CR-V CAUGHT FIRE? NOT PILOT? NOT SUV FROM OTHER MAKERS? THE ENGINE FIRE CANNOT BE SIMPLY EXPLAINED BY THE SLOPPY JOB OF TECHNICIAN PERFORMED AS IT HAPPENED/HAPPENS AT DIFFERENT STATES IN US.  NHTSA PLEASE OPEN THE INVESTIGATION AGAIN AS NUMBER OF ENGINE FIRE ARE INCREASING ACROSS US. PLEASE GIVE CONSUMER SAFE SUV AS IT SHOULD BE.*AK

2004,SUBARU,OUTBACK,ENGINE AND ENGINE COOLING,MY SUBARU FORESTER XT HAS HAD NUMEROUS PROBLEMS SINCE IT HAD 5000 MILES.  THE ENGINE PERFORMANCE IS INCONSISTENT.  THE CAR HAS AN INTERMITTENT MISS AT IDLE CRUISE CONTROL THAT DISENGAGES AT WILL IS DIFFICULT TO START INTERMITTENTLY; SPITTING AND SPUTTER FOR 30 SECONDS ACTS AS IF IT WILL STALL OCCASIONALLY WHILE BRAKING AND THE CLUTCH DOES NOT GRIP THE FLYWHEEL PROPERLY.  WHILE PASSING ON 2 LANE ROADS I HAVE NEARLY HAD NUMEROUS HEAD-ON ACCIDENTS; THE CAR DOES NOT ACCELERATE CONSISTENTLY.  THE CRUISE CONTROL DEFECT HAS NEARLY CAUSED MANY OTHER ACCIDENTS IN DISTINCT CONDITIONS:   1.  WHILE ASCENDING HILLS I HAVE NEARLY BEEN REAR-ENDED BY OTHER CARS WHEN MY CAR LOSES SPEED WITHOUT WARNING  2.  WHILE DESCENDING HILLS I HAVE NEARLY LOST CONTROL AS THE CAR ACCELERATES WHILE CRUISE CONTROL HAS DISENGAGED  I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE CAR WHEN I MUST TAKE OFF HARD ESPECIALLY WHEN CROSSING A BUSY STREET.  WHEN LAUNCHING HARD THE CLUTCH WILL SLIP EXCESSIVELY.  THE CAR WILL NOT ACCELERATE; IT WILL ONLY BURN THE CLUTCH CREATING A LARGE CLOUD OF SMOKE.  IT DOES NOT MATTER WHICH GEAR I SWITCH TOO OR HOW MUCH THROTTLE I APPLY; THE CLUTCH WILL NOT GRIP UNTIL IT COOLS DOWN.  I HAVE NEARLY BEEN HIT NUMEROUS TIMES BECAUSE OF THIS.  I AM EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS WITH THE BRAKE PEDAL.  AFTER BRAKING TO A STOP WHEN THE ENGINE IDLES DOWN THE BRAKE PEDAL WILL SINK AN ADDITIONAL HALF AN INCH.  I HAVE BROUGHT MY CAR TO 2 DIFFERENT DEALERSHIPS AND INVOLVED SUBARU'S REGIONAL SERVICE MANAGER.  ALL EFFORTS TO REPAIR MY CAR HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL OR IGNORED.  THE DEALERSHIPS HAVE ONLY ADJUSTED SWITCHES AND REPLACED AN OXYGEN SENSOR.

DEALERSHIPS AND MITSUBISHI REFUSE TO FIX THE PROBLEM. *AK    THE CAR HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE DEALERSHIP REPEATEDLY (5 TIMES) TO REMEDY THE BRAKING PROBLEM - EVERY FEW MONTHS (WITH LESS THAN 2500 MILES SINCE THE LAST TIME THE ROTORS WERE REPLACED).     THE CAR WAS TAKEN TO THE WEST BROAD MITSUBISHI DEALERSHIP IN RICHMOND VA WHERE IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE PROBLEM WAS BEING CAUSED BY WARPED ROTORS. THE DEALER RESURFACED THE ROTORS TO FIX THE PROBLEM. HOWEVER THE PROBLEM RE-OCCURED AFTER 7000 MILES. WEST BROAD MITSUBISHI THEN CLAIMED THAT THEY REPLACED THE ROTORS. 5000 MILES LATER THE BRAKES BEGAN SQUEELING AND THE VIBRATION STARTED AGAIN. I TOOK THE CAR BACK IN TO THE WEST BROAD DEALERSHIP AND THEY TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD TO REPLACE THE ROTORS A SECOND TIME TO REMEDY THE PROBLEM. BARELY 2300 MILES LATER THE CAR HAD TO BE TAKEN BACK TO ANOTHER MITSUBISHI DEALER (STOHLMAN) IN VIENNA VA. THE DEALER TOLD ME THE (NEW) ROTORS HAVE WARPED AND THEYVE HAD TO BE RESURFACED. 2 WEEKS LATER (ABOUT 500 MILES) THE PROBLEM SHOWED UP AGAIN. AT THIS POINT I WROTE A COMPLAINT LETTER TO MITSUBISHI. AFTER 4 WEEKS A MITSUBISHI REP CAME TO THE DEALERSHIP TO CHECK THE PROBLEM - ONLY TO CLAIM THERE WAS NOTHING WORNG WITH THE CAR DESPITE OBVIOUS VIBRATION AND BRAKE SQUEELING. SUBSEQUENTLY A QUICK CHECK BY A THIRD-PARTY MECHANIC REVEALED PROBLEMS WITH THE ROTORS AND CALIPERS.

SEVERAL MORNINGS WHILE BACKING OUT OF OUR DRIVEWAY THE CAR'S BRAKE PRESSURE DID NOT EMPLOY THE BRAKES IN THE NORMAL SAFE FASHION.  WHEN HE WAS ABOUT HALF WAY DOWN THE DRIVEWAY HE APPLIED THE BRAKES THE PEDAL WAS HARD AND NONCOMPLIANT (THE CAR DID NOT STOP OR SLOW DOWN) UNTIL HE APPLIED THE BRAKE PEDAL VERY HARD.  WHILE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DRIVEWAY RIGHT BEFORE EXITING ONTO THE SIDEWALK THE BRAKES BEGAN WORKING AS NORMAL.  THIS SITUATION HAPPENED EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS WARMED UP FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES HE TAPPED THE BRAKES UPON ROLLING BACKWARD A COUPLE OF FEET OR SO TO MAKE SURE THEY WERE WORKING PROPERLY.  THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY.  THIS SAFETY PROBLEM IS INTERMITTENT.   I LEFT MY CAR OVERNIGHT WITH A LOCAL DEALER TO HAVE A MECHANIC GO THROUGH THE BRAKE SYSTEM BASED UPON THIS SAFETY ISSUE.  I WAS TOLD BY THE MECHANIC AND THE SERVICE CONSULTANT MY BRAKES ARE FINE NOTHING UNUSUAL WAS DETECTED MY CAR IS PERFECT.

TURNS OUT THEY DID NOT SPRAY AND SIX MONTHS AFTER THE WARRANTY ENDED THE FRAME WAS DEEMED SO CORRODED BY AN OIL CHANGE MECHANIC AT AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESS I CAN NO LONGER DRIVE THE VEHICLE. TOYOTA AND THE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP WILL NOT ADDRESS THE LETTER THEY SENT ME AND THE FACT THEY DID NOT SPRAY CRCS AS DISCUSSED. THE VEHICLE IS VERY UNSAFE I DID WAS I WAS TOLD AND THE DEALERSHIP IS NEGLIGENT IF FOLLOWING BINARY RULES OF THE WARRANTY--REPLACE THE VEHICLE OR SPRAY CRCS. THE DEALERSHIP CLAIMS THEY HAD NO RESPONSIBILITY TO DO ANYTHING"" BUT A LETTER I RECEIVED FROM TOYOTA SAYS DIFFERENTLY. THE VEHICLE WAS SERVICED REGULARLY AND RAN WELL AND HAS NO ISSUES BUT THE FRAME MAKES THE VEHICLE UNSAFE AND INOPERABLE. THE FRAME OF THE VEHICLE IS NO COLLAPSING AS WELL. THE FRAME IS ROTTED THROUGH."""

2015,SUBARU,FORESTER,ELECTRICAL SYSTEM,"I HAD A REMOTE STARTER INSTALLED BY SOME ONE OTHER THAN SUBARU.  THE STARTER FAILED REPEATEDLY SO I TOOK IT IN.  WAS TOLD AND GIVEN A PRINT OUT REFLECTING A LOW BATTERY.  I TOOK IT TO NORTH TOWNE SUBARU ON SHERIDAN DR. IT IS A 20 MILE TRIP ONE WAY THEY SAID NO PROBLEM CHARGED THE BATTERY ANY WAY AND SENT ME HOME.   I PURCHASED THE FORESTER IN SEPT.2014 GOT THE STARTER FOR CHRISTMASAND AFTER THE VISIT  TO SUBARU IT WORKED SOMETIMES.  THIS WINTER AGAIN IT FAILED TO START.  NOW THAT THE WINTER HAS BECOME EXTREMELY COLD I RETURNED TO THE INSTALLER WHO REPLACED IT AND IT STILL FAILED DUE TO A LOW BATTERY.  THIS AS I UNDERSTAND IT IS A CONTINUING PROBLEM WITH THIS MODEL AND THE FIX IS A STRONGER BATTERY.  I AM NOT ABOUT TO TAKE ANOTHER TRIP TO SUBARU IN ERIE CO. AS I AM IN PAIN MOST OF THE TIME AND DRIVING LONG DISTANCES INCREASES THE PROBLEM.  I TOLD THE STARTER STORE TO ORDER ME A BATTERY TO FIX THE PROBLEM AS I CAN'T SEE SUBARU IN AMHERST DOING ANYTHING FOR ME.  BUT I DO THINK SUBARU SHOULD REIMBURSE ME.  OF COURSE I  WILL NOT HOLD MY BREATH.  ALSO I WILL NEVER GO TO THAT DEALERSHIP AGAIN.!!!!!!"""
2013,NISSAN,ALTIMA,SUSPENSION,"THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE WAS DETECTED DEFINITELY AROUND 1 YEAR OF OWNERSHIP OF MY AT THEN BRAND NEW 2013 ALTIMA WHICH WAS PURCHASED 12/2013 THAT MY REAR SHOCKS WERE LEAKING. HAVE NOT TO THIS DATE GOTTEN THEM FIXED BECAUSE IT COSTS TOO MUCH AND I'M TOLD IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER ANY WARRANTY. OUT OF ALL THE TIMES I'VE TAKEN MY VEHICLE IN THIS PROBLEM HAS ONLY BEEN BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION 2 TIMES. IF SERVICE WAS REALLY DOING THEIR JOB IT WOULD BE NOTED EACH TIME I VISIT. IN ANY CASE ANOTHER PROBLEM WITH MY SO-CALLED NEW"" VEHICLE. MY POOR PASSENGERS HAVE A VERY ROUGH RIDE AND IS AFFECTING MY BRAKING WHERE IT DELAYS MY STOP. I CONTINUE FIGHTING WITH NISSAN (BOTH DEALER WHERE PURCHASE WAS MADE AND CORP) AND NOTHING. I DIDN'T GET INTO A SALES CONTRACT FOR A NEW VEHICLE WHERE I HAVE TO HAVE MAJOR PARTS REPLACED EVERY 6 MO-1 YEAR. MY PAYMENTS ARE HIGH ENOUGH WITHOUT HAVING THE HEADACHES OF THIS VEHICLE."""
2013,NISSAN,ALTIMA,POWER TRAIN,NOT 2 YEARS YET OF OWNERSHIP (MAY 2015) AND MY CAR DECIDES TO NOT ACCELERATE ON ME. I WOULD HAVE TO FLOOR IT TO GET IT TO FINALLY KICK IN AND DRIVE UNTIL I STOPPED AT THE NEXT LIGHT. THERE WERE NO WARNING LIGHTS OR ANYTHING LETTING ME KNOW OF ANY PROBLEMS. HAD 2 NEAR COLLISIONS WITH MY FAMILY IN THE CAR TRYING TO GET MY CAR TO THE NEAREST DEALER TO HAVE IT CHECKED OUT. DEALER THOUGHT IT WAS TRANSMISSION AND ALTERNATOR BUT UPON WARRANTY REP DIAGNOSING VEHICLE IT WAS DECIDED THAT IT NEEDED A NEW ALTERNATOR. THIS IS A HUGE CONCERN FOR ME AND THE SAFETY OF MY FAMILY AND PASSENGERS NOT TO HAVE A LIGHT GO OFF TO WARN ME OF PROBLEMS AND JUST TO HAVE IT HAPPEN WHILE DRIVING.
2013,NISSAN,ALTIMA,ELECTRICAL SYSTEM,BRAND NEW VEHICLE JUST SHY OF 1 YEAR BOUGHT AND CHECK ENGINE GOES ON TWICE FOR REPROGRAM OF OXYGEN SENSOR ONCE IN TOWN BEFORE THANKSGIVING WEEK IN NOVEMBER 2014 AND A SECOND TIME WHILE OUT OF TOWN FOR THE THANKSGIVING HOLIDAYS. FRUSTRATING THAT I TOOK THE VEHICLE IN TO THE DEALER TO GET FIXED AND IT WASN'T DONE THE FIRST TIME. IT LOOKS LIKE THEY JUST CLEARED THE SYSTEM AND THE LIGHT AND IT CAME BACK ON WHILE OUT OF TOWN FOR THE SAME PROBLEM.
2013,NISSAN,ALTIMA,ELECTRICAL SYSTEM,THIS IS A COMBINATION OF PROBLEMS. APPROXIMATELY AROUND NOV. 7 2015 THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON WHILE AT THE DEALER (ALMOST ONE YEAR AFTER THE LAST TIME). I HAVE NOT OWNED MY VEHICLE 2 YEARS YET. I THOUGHT THEY HAD TAKEN CARE OF IT WHEN THEY TOLD ME THE LIGHT SHOULDN'T COME BACK ON. THEY SAID THE CODE WAS FOR REPROGRAMMING THE MASS AIR SYSTEM. ABOUT 2 WEEKS LATER THE SAME LIGHT CAME ON BUT THIS TIME I LOST ACCELERATION AGAIN WHILE GETTING ON THE FREEWAY. I HAD A COUPLE OF CLOSE CALLS ON BEING REAR-ENDED WHILE HAVING MY SON IN THE CAR. I HAD TO GET OFF IMMEDIATELY AND DRIVE DOWN TO THE DEALER WHICH TOOK ME IT SEEMED FOREVER BECAUSE IT WOULD BARELY MOVE. I HAD TO LEAVE THE VEHICLE AS IT WAS CLOSING. THE FOLLOWING DAY I WAS CALLED AND TOLD THAT IT REQUIRED REPROGRAMMING OF THE MASS AIR SYSTEM. I HAD THEM DO IT BUT IT TOOK THEM 1 DAY TO RETURN THE VEHICLE TO ME. ABOUT 2 DAYS LATER THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME BACK ON AGAIN AND I TOOK IT BACK TO THE SAME DEALER. THIS TIME FINDING THE PROBLEM WASN'T AS EASY. THEY KEPT MY VEHICLE FOR 3 DAYS BEFORE LETTING ME KNOW THAT I NEEDED TO HAVE THE THROTTLE CHAMBER REPLACED. REALLY NOW...CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON A TOTAL OF 2 TIMES IN 1 YEAR + 2 MORE TIME IN ANOTHER YEAR 1 ALTERNATOR REPLACED IN 1 YEAR  1 THROTTLE  CHAMBER REPLACED IN ALMOST 2 YEARS LEAKING REAR SHOCKS IN 1 YEAR AND NISSAN DOES NOTHING TO REPLACE MY VEHICLE WHICH IS A CONSTANT SAFETY HAZARD FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.

2005,NISSAN,FRONTIER,POWER TRAIN,LAST NOVEMBER 6TH I HIT A DEER FRONT IMPACT. TOOK TRUCK TO LOCAL GARAGE TO HAVE IT SERVICED. THE ONLY DAMAGE THEY SAID OCCURRED WAS BODY DAMAGE. 3WKS LATER GOT MY TRUCK BACK WITH BODY DAMAGE REPAIRED. ABOUT 3WKS AFTER THAT I STARTED TO NOTICE A SLIGHT VIBRATION IN MY TRUCK WHEN I GOT TO A CERTAIN SPEED. I REALLY DIDN'T THINK NOTHING OF IT AND THOUGHT MAYBE I HAD A TIRE OUT OF BALANCE. WELL THE VIBRATION STARTED GETTING WORSE AND I STARTED TO NOTICE A STRONG VIBRATION AND DECREASE IN POWER WHEN IT SHIFTED. SO I TOOK THE TRUCK BACK TO THE GARAGE TO SEE IF THEY COULD FIGURE ANYTHING OUT. I THOUGHT MAYBE THE DEER CAUSED MORE DAMAGE THAN EXPECTED BUT THEY COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING. THE DIDN'T CHARGE ME ANYTHING BECAUSE THEY FOUND NOTHING WRONG. SO I DROVE IT FOR ANOTHER 2 WEEKS AND IT GOT WORSE. I TOOK IT TO A LOCAL NISSAN DEALERSHIP AND WITHIN 30MINS THEY DETERMINED A TRANSMISSION COOLER RUPTURE AND THAT IT BASICALLY HAS RUINED MY TRANSMISSION AND WOULD NEED TO REPLACE IT A SERVICE CHARGE OF $6000!!! THEY TOLD ME I WAS JUST OUT OF WARRANTY ON IT. I'VE BEEN READING ON THIS ISSUE AND KNOW NISSAN HAS AN EXTENDED WARRANTY OF 10YRS OR 100000 MILES. I WENT TO THE DEALER ON THE 19TH OF JANUARY. 19 DAYS OUT OR WARRANTY!!! WHEN I HAD ORIGINALLY HAD AN ISSUE IN LATE DECEMBER AND NOTHING WAS FOUND!!! THE TRUCK IS BARELY 10YRS OLD AND HAS LESS THAN 90000 MILES ON IT.

THE CONTACT STATED THAT THE DEALER WAS CONTACTED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS TO SCHEDULE THE RECALL REPAIR FOR NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 15V285000 (AIR BAGS). THE PART WAS UNAVAILABLE FOR THE REPAIR.

2012,NISSAN,ROGUE,ELECTRICAL SYSTEM,1.  NISSAN REFUSES TO TAKE ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING DUNLOP 7000A/S 225/55/18 TIRES ON THIS VEHICLE WHICH ARE DANGEROUS IN ANY CONDITION BESIDES DRY ROAD CONDITIONS THESE TIRES ARE INHERENTLY DEFECTIVE ALSO FILED COMPLAINT WITH GOODYEAR TIRE WHICH REFUSES TO ACKNOWLEDGE ANY ISSUES WITH THIS TIRE.    2.  THE TRAFFIC FEATURE OF THE NAVIGATION SYSTEM DOES NOT WORK.  AFTER 20 HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH SIRIUSXM THEY ADVISED ME THIS IS A NISSAN ISSUE.  NISSAN ALSO REFUSES TO TAKE ANY ACTION.    3.  THE RADIO TURNS ON AND OFF OR THE SOURCE OF THE MEDIA CHANGES WHEN YOU BLOW THE HORN   ALSO NISSAN HAS NO SOLUTION OR FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM.
2015,MITSUBISHI,OUTLANDER SPORT,POWER TRAIN,MY 2015 MITSUBISHI OUTLANDER SPORT HAS ALSO SEEMED TO HESITATE AFTER COMING TO A STOP AND ATTEMPTING TO ACCELERATE AGAIN. I'D HAVE TO PUSH THE GAS AGAIN TO GO. A SLIGHT JERK FEEL. I BOUGHT IT IN MARCH 2015 AND IT'S DONE THIS SINCE MAY WITH ONLY AROUND 5000 MILES. I MOSTLY DRIVE HIGHWAY SO TO FEEL THIS WHEN YA COMING INTO A TOWN HAS ME CONCERNED. BUT OF COURSE BY THEN THE DEALER DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE THE CAR BACK. THE DEALER SEES NOTHING WRONG BUT I'M SURE WITH ALL OF US POSTING THE SAME COMMON ISSUE THERE IS SOMETHING DEFINITELY WRONG WITH THE TRANSMISSION. GUESS I'M STUCK WITH THE WORRY UNTIL I CAN TRADE IT IN.
2009,NISSAN,ALTIMA HYBRID,UNKNOWN OR OTHER,CAR WOULDN'T START DUE TO A FAULTY STEERING WHEEL LOCK SWITCH. THIS HAS BEEN A CONTINUING PROBLEM ON ALTIMAS AND OTHER MODELS. NISSAN FAILED TO REPORT PROBLEM TO ITS CUSTOMERS.
2005,HONDA,PILOT,POWER TRAIN,WHEN THE VEHICLE GETS TO ABOUT 30 MPH YOU FEEL A SHUDDER IN THE TRANSMISSION.  AFTER MOMENTARILY LOSING INERTIA THE VEHICLE IS ABLE TO INCREASE SPEED AND CONTINUE WITHOUT HESITATION.  I'VE HAD THE DEALER CHECK IT AND THEY THINK IT MAY BE A FAULTY TORQUE CONVERTER.  THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS.
2006,TOYOTA,COROLLA,AIR BAGS,TL* TAKATA RECALL. THE CONTACT OWNS A 2006 TOYOTA COROLLA.

2001,HONDA,ACCORD,STRUCTURE,SUBFRAME RUST CAUSED BY MISPOSITIONED A/C DRAIN PIPE    DROPPED MY CAR OFF FOR HER 200K TUNE IN NH. THE MECHANIC SAID THE SUBFRAME UNDERNEATH THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT WAS SHOT. I DEBATED WHETHER TO SPEND $1100 FOR A USED SUBFRAME AND LABOR. DECIDED IT WAS A GAMBLE BUT PROBABLY WORTH IT. DROPPED IT OFF TWO DAYS LATER AND HE SHOWED ME WHERE. I GRABBED THE FRAME AND IT JUST CRUMBLED. WITH THE NEW SUBFRAME AND TUNE SHE RUNS LIKE NEW EVEN AT 200K.    LATER I DID MORE RESEARCH LATER AND FOUND THAT OTHER PEOPLE HAVE HAD THE SAME ISSUE. I GOT THE CAR UP ON A FRIEND'S LIFT AND FOUND THE A/C DRAIN HOSE. IT WAS HIGH UP IN THE CAR AND REALLY SHORT! IT POINTED DIRECTLY AT THE SUBFRAME. I SIMPLY REPLACED THE HOSE CLAMPED IT ON THEN TIED THE END TO A THINGY FURTHER DOWN SO THAT THE OPENING POINTED AT THE GROUND. LIKE $2 IN PARTS AND 20 MINUTES AND I'M AN AMATEUR. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT HONDA NEVER OFFICIALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THIS DESIGN DEFECT. I GET THAT THEY DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR SUBFRAME REPLACEMENTS - THEY'RE A BUSINESS YADDA YADDA. BUT IT'S SUCH A BASIC OVERSIGHT WITH AN EASY SOLUTION. JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE DILIGENCE ON THEIR PART WOULD HAVE SAVED ME OVER A THOUSAND BUCKS. SUBFRAME RUST IS A MAJOR SAFETY ISSUE. THEY DESERVE TO BE PUNISHED FOR SUCH LAZINESS AND NEGLIGENCE.    TO NIP THIS IN THE BUD: YES I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND. THERE'S A LOT OF SALT ON THE ROADS BUT I WASH THE UNDERCARRIAGE REGULARLY. AND IF IT WERE GENERAL WEAR-N-TEAR THE ENTIRE SUBFRAME WOULD HAVE HAD SIMILAR LEVELS OF DAMAGE. HOWEVER THE ROT WAS LOCALIZED DIRECTLY UNDER THE A/C DRAIN HOSE.    ALSO THE DEALERSHIP SAID NOTHING ABOUT SUBFRAME RUST WHEN I BROUGHT THE CAR IN FOR THE AIRBAG RECALL. SOME 100 POINT INSPECTION HUH?
2003,NISSAN,ALTIMA,ENGINE,LOOSE POWER VALVE SCREWS - WHILE DRIVING MY 2003 NISSAN ALTIMA 2.5 S BOTH ON CITY STREETS AND ON THE FREEWAY THE VEHICLE ARBITRARILY RAN SUPER ROUGH TO THE POINT OF ALMOST COMPLETELY CUTTING OFF IN MIDDLE OF TRAFFIC LANES. ONE INSTANCE WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS BECAUSE I WAS MAKING A LEFT TURN ACROSS TRAFFIC LANES AND THE ENGINE STALLED IN THE MIDDLE OF OPPOSING TRAFFIC LANES AND I WAS ALMOST T-BONED BY ONCOMING CARS. FINALLY THE ENGINE WOULDN'T START AT ALL ONE DAY SO I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO THE DEALER AND THEY IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM WITH INTAKE POWER VALVE SCREWS THAT NEEDED TO BE REPLACED AT A SIGNIFICANT PRICE. I HAD TO GET THE CAR TOWED ONCE BEFORE AND THE DEALER DIAGNOSED THE PROBLEM AS A DEFECTIVE CAMSHAFT POSITION SENSOR NOT COVERED BY ANY RECALLS BUT OBVIOUSLY A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM FOR 2003 NISSAN ALTIMA OWNERS. AFTER DOING MY OWN RESEARCH THERE SEEMS TO BE A LARGE NUMBER OF OWNERS OF THIS SAME CAR EXPERIENCING THE SAME POWER VALVE SCREW PROBLEM ALSO. I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS A RECALL ON  2004 AND 2005 NISSAN ALTIMAS FOR THIS PROBLEM WHICH HAVE THE SAME ENGINE AS MY CAR.
2013,HONDA,CR-V,STRUCTURE,WHEN THE WEATHER IS  COLD MY CARGO LIFT WILL NOT OPEN.  I HAVE TAKEN MY VEHICLE IN TO THE LOCAL DEALERSHIP AND THEY PRETTY MUCH THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY.  EVEN MY HUSBAND CAN'T GET THE LIFT TO OPEN WHEN THE WEATHER IS COLD.

2006,TOYOTA,MATRIX,AIR BAGS,TAKATA RECALL. I RECEIVED A RECALL LETTER FROM THE MANUFACTURER IN AUGUST OF 2015. IT IS NOW 1/22/16 AND THE PROBLEM HAS STILL NOT BEEN ADDRESSED. I CALLED TOYOTA CUSTOMER SERVICE ON 10/22/15 AND THEY INFORMED ME THAT THE REPAIRS WERE CURRENTLY IN PHASE 2 AND THAT CALIFORNIA WAS PHASE 4. SINCE THEN I HAVE HAD TO RENT A CAR ON ONE OCCASION WHEN I NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE 4 PASSENGERS AND UNLESS THIS GETS FIXED BY MID-MARCH I WILL LIKELY NEED TO RENT A CAR FOR 4 DAYS FOR A FAMILY TRIP. THIS IS NOW COSTING ME MONEY WHICH I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY IF MY CAR WAS SERVICED IN A REASONABLE TIME-FRAME. IT'S NOW BEEN 5 MONTHS SINCE RECEIVING THE RECALL NOTICE AND I HAVE YET TO RECEIVE A LETTER AS TO WHEN I CAN GET MY CAR FIXED. FRANKLY THIS IS VERY UNACCEPTABLE AND I FEEL THAT IF TOYOTA CAN'T MAKE THIS RIGHT THEN THEY SHOULD PAY FOR THE RENTAL CAR I WILL NEED IN MARCH.
2004,TOYOTA,SIENNA,UNKNOWN OR OTHER,TRACTION CONTROL SENSOR PROBLEM 2004 TOYOTA SIENNA XLE APPROX 128000-133000 MILES.   SAFETY ISSUE:  WHILE DRIVING WITHIN THE POSTED SPEED LIMITS OF 35-45 MPH THE VAN HAS SEIZED UP (SLOWS DOWN ON IT'S OWN WITHOUT WARNING) AS AN INTERNAL ALARM SIMULTANEOUSLY SOUNDS (THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I DIDN?T KNOW THE VAN HAD AN INTERNAL ALARM).  THIS HAS HAPPENED FOUR TIMES (SEPT. AND OCTOBER 2015 AND TWICE THIS WEEK 1/18/16 AND 1/22/16).  EACH TIME THE VEHICLE WAS TRAVELING ON DRY STREETS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE LAST EPISODE.  AFTER THE FIRST EPISODE I TOOK THE VAN TO OUR MECHANIC ON THE DAY OF OCCURRENCE; WE TOOK A 10 MINUTE TEST DRIVE WHERE HE RAN DIAGNOSTIC TEST HOWEVER NO PROBLEMS WERE DETECTED.  THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED OUR MECHANIC DID SOME RESEARCH AND FOUND OUT IT WAS A TRACTION CONTROL SENSOR FAIL.  AFTER TODAY?S EPISODE I WILL HAVE THE SENSOR DISENGAGED AS WE HAVE HAD THE VAN 12 + YEARS AND HAVE NOT HAD A NEED FOR THE TRACTION CONTROL TO TAKE OVER.  THIS IS NOT ONLY DANGEROUS BUT VERY SCARY FOR THE DRIVER AND PASSENGERS.  PLEASE TOYOTA GET THIS PROBLEM FIXED.

THIS WAS AN ISSUE WHEN WE BOUGHT THE CAR AND WE WERE NOT INFORMED OF IT. YOU CAN TELL FROM HOW MUCH MOLD AND MILDEW THAT THIS IS NO NEW PROBLEM. TRIED TO RESEARCH IT ONLINE AND THIS IS NO ISOLATED ISSUE. MANY PEOPLE ARE HAVING THIS ISSUE WITH THE 2011 PILOT. THIS IS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE WET SHOES CAN SLIP ON SLICK WORN OUT PEDALS AND THEN YOU HAVE AN ACCIDENT. STILL TO DATE HAVEN'T FOUND LEAK AND HONDA JUST WANTS TO CHARGE TO FIX"" THE ISSUE AND THE NEXT TIME IT RAINS THE FLOORBOARD IS FULL OF WATER AGAIN."""
2009,NISSAN,ALTIMA,STEERING,TRIED TO START THE VEHICLE TO RUN ERRANDS AND THE VEHICLE WOULD NOT START. I NOTICED THE THE KEY LIGHT ON THE DASH BOARD WAS ON. (HAD NEVER HAPPEN BEFORE) AFTER SOME RESEARCH I FOUND OUT THAT A STEERING WHEEL LOCK FAILURE WAS A COMMON PROBLEM ON THIS MAKE AND MODEL.

NICE MY TRUCK HAS ONLY 49000 MILES ON IT NO OFF ROAD USE AND NOW GETTING TO THE POINT OF USELESS.  THANKS NISSAN. OH DON'T FORGET THE TOWING CHARGE TO THE NEAREST DEALER OVER ONE HOUR AWAY FOR REPAIRS.    I JUST STARTED WITH TRANSMISSION SYMPTOMS OF INTERMITTENT GRINDING WITH OVERDRIVE ENGAGED ON THE SHIFTIER.

I TRIED TO PULL TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD QUICKLY BUT I HAD NO ENGINE POWER. I COASTED TO THE SHOULDER OF THE ROAD AND CALLED MY HUSBAND TO PICK ME UP. I HAD THE VEHICLE TOWED TO MY MECHANIC AND HE ADVISED US THAT THE AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION FLUID HAD CONTAMINATED THE ANTI-FREEZE AND VICE VERSA AND THAT I'D NEED A NEW TRANSMISSION AND RADIATOR INSTALLED FOR $5500.00. HE ALSO ADDED THAT NISSAN HAD JUST LOST A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT TO REPAIR THE VEHICLES AFFECTED BUT THE CATCH IS THAT YOUR VEHICLE CAN NOT HAVE OVER 100000 MILES ON IT. FROM MY RESEARCH IN THE FORUMS THE ISSUE DOES NOT ARISE UNTIL THE VEHICLE MILEAGE EXCEEDS 100000 SO WE'RE BASICALLY SCREWED FOR REPAIRS ON OUR NISSANS WITH 100001 MILES OR MORE. I'M DOUBLE SCREWED AS I HAVE 2 2006 NISSAN'S.  MY OTHER VEHICLE IS CURRENTLY INOPERABLE DUE TO ATF CONTAMINATION.

I TOOK IT TO DAYTONA TOYOTA IN DAYTONA BEACH FLORIDA TO HAVE ANOTHER RECALL ON THE CAR REMEDIED. THEY TOLD ME THEY WOULD BE CALLING ME WHEN THEY HAD THE INFLATOR MODULE PART IN FOR MY CAR. OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS THEY CALLED ME WHEN THE PART CAME IN AND EACH TIME I WAS SENT HOME BECAUSE IT TURNS OUT THEY DID NOT HAVE THE PART AFTER ALL.

IT'S SCARY TO DRIVE A CAR THAT MIGHT LEAVE YOU STRANDED EVERY TIME YOU TURN IT OFF. THIS HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS."""
2014,HONDA,ACCORD,AIR BAGS,TAKATA RECALL: I WANT TO KNOW IF MY CAR HAS A DEFECTIVE AIRBAG. HONDA ADVISED ME THAT I HAVE A TAKATA AIRBAG ON THE PASSENGER SIDE FRONT. I HAVE ASKED IF THIS AIRBAG USES THE AMMONIUM NITRATE PROPELLANT - WHICH IS SUSPECTED TO BE THE SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM - AND THEY HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO TELL ME. I HAVE WRITTEN TWO LETTERS TO THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN HONDA & HAVE HAD TWO PHONE RESPONSES BOTH OF WHICH HAVE NOT ANSWERED THE QUESTION. THEY CLEARLY KNOW THE ANSWER AND I WOULD LIKE THEM TO CONFIRM IN WRITING AS TO WHETHER AMMONIUM NITRATE IS USED IN THE AIRBAG IN MY VEHICLE.
2006,TOYOTA,TUNDRA,ENGINE,WHILE TOWING A TRAVEL TRAILER ON A MOUNTAIN PASS FREEWAY IN WA STATE WITH NO SHOULDER. GOING UP THE HILL AND STARTED TO PUT THE FOOT DOWN ON GAS TO GET SPEED UP FOR THE UPCOMING STEEP HILL THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT CAME ON AND ALL POWER WAS LOST ENGINE WENT INTO LIMP MODE WITH NO PLACE TO PULL OVER. I HAD TO TRAVEL AT 8MPH UP THE HILL UNTIL I FOUND A SUITABLE PULL OUT SPOT FOR THE TRUCK AND 30FT TRAILER. I WAS ALMOST WAS REAR ENDED MULTIPLE TIMES EVEN WITH EMERGENCY FLASHERS GOING. THIS HAS HAPPENED 2X BOTH IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT DOING THE EXACT SAME THING. THE FIRST TIME WAS ONLY A FEW MONTHS AFTER MY EXTENDED WARRANTY RAN OUT IN AND THE DEALER WAS UNWILLING TO DO ANYTHING TO HELP OUT. BUT THEY WERE MORE THAN HAPPY TO CHARGE $100 TO TELL ME IT WOULD COST $4200 TO REPAIR IT INCLUDING THE SECONDARY $1800 EGC VACUUM PUMP WHICH ONLY RUNS AS THE DEALER TOLD ME 30-45 SECONDS AT START UP THEN THE PUMP DOES NOTHING. WHY DOES THIS OCCUR AFTER RUNNING 2+ HOURS??  THE SECOND TIME IT HAPPENED I WAS TOWING THE SAME TRAILER AT THE EXACT SAME PLACE ENDING UP GOING ONLY 8 MPH UPHILL AGAIN ON THE HIWAY W/60MPH LIMIT!! THIS TIME AT THE ADVICE OF A FRIEND ONCE OUT OF TRAFFIC. I DISCONNECTED THE BATTERY FOR 10 MINUTES RECONNECTED IT AND THE COMPUTER HAD RESET ITSELF AND THE TRUCK RAN FINE THE LAST 45 MINUTES HOME. I NO LONGER TRAVEL THAT ROAD WITH NO SHOULDER AS I AM AFRAID IT'S GOING TO CAUSE A MAJOR ACCIDENT. TOYOTA IS AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM IN THE 05-06 MODELS. YET ARE FIXING IT UNDER RECALL ON 07+ MODELS BUT WON'T HELP ANYONE ELSE WITH AN '06 OR OLDER. THIS IS MY 3RD TOYOTA AND LAST. THE FIRST TIME IT HAPPENED I HAD 60000 MILES THE 2ND TIME IT WAS AT 68500 MILES. I ONLY HAVE 87500 ON IT NOW AT 10 1/2 YEARS OF OWNERSHIP. I AM ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR A TRUCK THAT HAS A COMPANY THAT WILL STAND BEHIND ITS BRAND. I'M DONE WITH TOYOTA. THEY STILL HAVEN'T FIXED MY AIRBAGS EITHER!!
2009,NISSAN,ALTIMA,ELECTRICAL SYSTEM,STEERING LOCK CONTROL UNIT FAILS TO DISENGAGE EVEN THOUGH KEY (FOB) IS PRESENT.  DOORS AND TRUNK WILL UNLOCK/LOCK SO VEHICLE RECOGNIZES FOB/KEY.  NISSAN HAD A WARRANTY FIX BUT DID NOT NOTIFY OWNERS.   NOW PERIOD HAS CLOSED LEAVING OWNER WIT H A $1000+ BILL SO CAR CAN BE USED.
2014,TOYOTA,SEQUOIA,UNKNOWN OR OTHER,1.THE WINDSCREEN CANNOT RESIST TINY PIECES OF STONE-LIKE DEBRIS OF ABOUT .001CM DIAMETERS THAT SOMETIMES FALL FROM BIGGER TRUCK AND TRAILER AHEAD OF YOU. I HAVE A PROBLEM OF THE DESCRIPTION ABOVE (MY WINDSCREEN HAS A TINY DEFORMATION AS A RESULT OF UNSUSPECTED CONTACT WITH SUCH ROAD HAZARDS) OF WHICH I CALLED TOYOTA AND FILED A COMPLAINT. I WAS TOLD TO TAKE MY CAR TO DEALERSHIP FOR INSPECTION THEY CONCLUDED THAT THEY WILL NOT COVER IT BECAUSE IT'S EXTERNAL FACTOR. THIS CAR IN QUESTION IS LESS THAN 12000 MILES WHEN IT OCCURRED. I HAVE OTHER CARS I HAVE DRIVEN FOR MORE THAN 10-13 YEAR UNDER SIMILAR CONDITION WITHOUT INCIDENT.    2.RECENTLY I NOTICED MY GPS AND ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WAS FROZEN UP OR RESTART IN THE MIDDLE OF MY TRIPS. WHEN IT FROZEN I WOULD BE UNABLE TO ADJUST THE VOLUME OF THE RADIO OR TUNE OFF OR ON. THE GPS WILL RESTART AND RE-ROUTE ME TO UNDESIRED DESTINATION. THIS HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING FOR ME AND MY FAMILY.    3.THE TIRE PRESSURE MONITOR IS MALFUNCTION; EVEN IF MY TIRE PRESSURE IS AT A RECOMMENDED LEVEL IT WILL STILL DISPLAY THE NOTIFICATION.

2010,NISSAN,ROGUE,POWER TRAIN,THE CAR DEVELOPED A PROBLEM WHERE THE TRANSMISSION WAS SLIPPING AND I NOTICED FLUID LEAKING.  TOOK TO DEALER AND I HAD ADDITIONAL COVERAGE FOR REPAIRS AND BREAK DOWN.  THEY TOLD ME THE ENCLOSED TRANSMISSION DEVELOPED A LEAK DUE TO CORROSION.  THAT CORROSION DAMAGE IS NOT COVERED AND IT COST $400.00 TO REMOVE THE PART RATHER THAN REPLACE IT.  THE CAR HAS A GRINDING VIBRATING SOUND WHEN DRIVING.  THE CVT IS KNOWN TO HAVE THIS ISSUE AND THE TRANSMISSION IS SEALED SO YOU CAN'T CHECK YOUR FLUID LEVEL AND IT IS REQUIRED TO ONLY USE NISSAN MANUFACTURED TRANSMISSION FLUID.  THE CVT IS TIED INTO A FAIL SAFE MODE THAT CAN BE ACTIVATED BY HIGH TEMPERATURE IN THE ENGINE.  A COOLING KIT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED BUT I HAVE READ MIXED POSTS AS TO THE DEALERSHIPS CHARGING TO PUT IT INTO THE CAR.  THE CAR HAS BEEN KNOWN TO TOTALLY LOSE POWER WHILE DRIVING IF IT GOES INTO THIS FAIL SAFE MODE OR WHEN THE CVT JUST FAILS COMPLETELY.  WARRANTY WAS EXTENDED TO 10YRS/120000 MILES FOR CVT.
2015,NISSAN,ROGUE,UNKNOWN OR OTHER,THE AWD DOES NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY!  THE SALES REPRESENTITIVE TOLD ME  THIS VEHICLE  WAS AWD ALL OF THE TIME WHICH IT IS NOT.  THEREFORE I AM PERSUING THIS...  THIS IS AN UNSAFE VEHICLE AS I ALMOST COLLIDED WITH ANOTHER VEHICLE BECAUSE AWD CUT IN AND OUT IN AND OUT VERY DANGEROUS VEHICLE...
